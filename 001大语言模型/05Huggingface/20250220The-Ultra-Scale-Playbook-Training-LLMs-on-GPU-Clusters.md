If you fancy adding a podcast feeling to your reading experience, feel free to listen to the NotebookLM hosts discussing the first sections of this book as you're reading along.

如果你想为阅读体验增添一些播客氛围，不妨在阅读的同时，收听 NotebookLM 的主持人对本书第一部分的讨论。

Let’s start by quickly reviewing the very basics of model training before we start to scale to many GPUs. When a model is trained on a single GPU, the training typically consists of three steps:

在开始扩展到多个 GPU 之前，让我们先快速回顾一下模型训练的基础知识。当模型使用单张 GPU 训练时，训练过程通常包含以下三个步骤：

a forward pass which passes inputs through the model to yield its outputs,
a backward pass to compute the gradients, and
an optimization step using the gradients to update the parameters
As we’ll see later, these steps may be repeated or intertwined but for now we’ll start simple.
It looks generally like this:

包括一次前向传播，将输入数据送入模型，得到输出结果；
一次反向传播，计算梯度；
以及一个优化步骤，利用梯度来更新模型参数。
后续我们会看到，这些步骤可能会重复或穿插进行，但现在我们先从最简单的流程开始。
整个过程大致如下：

悬停在网络元素上可以查看其详细信息如图所示，顶行上的框可以视为模型内部的连续层（与底行相同）。红色框代表每个层的相关梯度，这些梯度是在反向传播期间计算的。

The batch size (bs) is one of the important hyper-parameters for model training and affects both model convergence and throughput.

A small batch size can be useful early in training to quickly move along the training landscape reaching an optimal learning point. However, further along the model training, small batch sizes will keep gradients noisy and the model may not be able to converge to the most optimal final performances. At the other extreme, a large batch size while giving very accurate gradient estimations will tend to make less use of each training token rendering convergence slower and potentially wasting compute. You can find a nice early discussion of this topic in OpenAI’s paper on large batch training
[1] or Section 4.2 of MiniMax-01 technical report.

批量大小（bs）是模型训练过程中一个重要的超参数，它直接影响着模型的收敛速度和训练吞吐量。

在训练初期，较小的批量大小可能更有帮助，因为它可以使模型快速地在训练过程中找到一个较好的学习状态。我们可以把模型训练的过程想象成在一个地形图上寻找最优解，较小的批量可以帮助模型快速地移动。然而，在模型训练的后期，如果批量大小过小，会导致梯度估计出现较多的噪声，模型可能难以收敛到最佳的最终性能。另一方面，较大的批量大小虽然可以提供更准确的梯度估计，但会降低每个训练 Token 的利用率， 也就是说，模型需要看到更多的数据才能学到相同的知识，这会导致收敛速度变慢，并可能浪费计算资源。关于这个主题，您可以在 OpenAI 关于大批量训练的论文 [1] 或者 MiniMax-01 技术报告的 4.2 节中找到更详细的讨论。

For instance, during DeepSeek-V3/R1 training “the batch size is gradually increased from 3072 input sequences to 15360 in the training of the first 469B tokens, and then keeps at 15360 input samples in the remaining training”.

例如，在 DeepSeek-V3/R1 的训练过程中，「批量大小」在最初的 4690 亿个 Token（Token）的训练中，从 3072 个输入序列逐渐增加到 15360 个。在后续训练中，则保持 15360 个输入序列不变。

Batch size also affects the time it takes to train on a given text dataset: a small batch size will require more optimizer steps to train on the same amount of samples. Optimizer steps are costly (in compute time) and the total time to train will thus increase compared to using a larger batch size. This being said, note that the batch size can often be adjusted quite largely around the optimal batch size without major impact to the performance of the model, i.e. the sensitivity of final model performances to the exact batch size value is usually rather low around the optimal batch size.

批量大小还会影响在特定文本数据集上的训练时间。较小的批量大小意味着，训练相同数量的样本需要更多的优化器步骤。优化器步骤会消耗大量的计算资源，因此，相比于使用较大的批量大小，训练总时间会相应增加。然而，值得注意的是，批量大小可以在最佳值附近进行较大幅度的调整，而通常不会对模型性能产生显著影响。换句话说，最终模型性能对于精确批量大小值的敏感度，在最佳批量大小附近通常较低。

In the LLM pretraining community, batch sizes are commonly reported in terms of tokens rather than in number of samples (bst = Batch Size Tokens), this makes training numbers generally independent of the exact input sequence length used during the training.

在大语言模型（LLM）预训练领域，批量大小通常用 Token 数量来表示，而不是用样本数量（bst = Batch Size Tokens）。这样做通常是为了使训练的规模不受训练时所用输入序列长度的影响。

In the simplest case, training on a single machine, the bs (in samples) and bst can be computed from the model input sequence length (seq) as follows:

bst=bs∗seq
From here onward we’ll show the formulas for the batch size in terms of samples but you can always get its token-unit counterpart by multiplying it with the sequence length.

在最简单的情况下，即在单台机器上训练时，批量大小 bs（以样本数衡量）和 bst 可以通过模型输入序列长度 seq 计算得出：

bst=bs∗seq

从现在开始，我们将展示以样本数为单位的批量大小计算公式。您始终可以通过将样本数乘以序列长度，得到对应的以 Token 为单位的批量大小。

A sweet spot for recent LLM training is typically on the order of 4-60 million tokens per batch. The batch size as well as the training corpus have been steadily increasing over the years: Llama 1 was trained with a batch size of ~4M tokens for 1.4 trillions tokens while DeepSeek was trained with a batch size of ~60M tokens for 14 trillion tokens.

在最近的大语言模型（LLM/Large Language Model）训练中，一个理想的批次大小通常在 400 万到 6000 万个 Token 之间。近年来，批次大小和训练语料库都在持续增长：例如，Llama 1 使用约 400 万个 Token 的批次大小，训练了总计 1.4 万亿个 Token；而 DeepSeek 则使用约 6000 万个 Token 的批次大小，训练了高达 14 万亿个 Token。这也反映出大语言模型训练规模不断扩大的趋势。

And our first challenge is already coming ahead when scaling the training of our model to these large batch sizes: out-of-memory issues. What should we do when our GPU doesn’t have enough memory to hold a full batch of our target batch size?

我们面临的第一个挑战，是将模型训练扩展到大批量时出现的：内存溢出问题。当我们的 GPU 没有足够的内存来容纳目标大小的完整批量数据时，我们应该怎么做？

Let’s start by quickly understanding what led to our out-of-memory issue in the first place. This will help us gain some useful intuitions on the memory requirements for training a model.

让我们首先快速了解最初导致我们出现内存溢出问题的根本原因。这将帮助我们更好地理解训练模型所需的内存。

Memory usage in Transformers
When training a neural network model, one store several items in memory:

Model weights
Model gradients
Optimizer states
Activations needed to compute the gradients
📝 Note

Transformer 中的内存使用在训练神经网络模型时，有几个关键项目需要存储在内存中：

模型权重模型梯度优化器状态计算梯度所需的激活值（Activations)
📝 注意

You would think for a model you could compute the memory requirements exactly but there are a few additional memory occupants that makes it hard to be exact:

CUDA Kernels typically require 1-2 GB of GPU memory, which you can quickly verify by running import torch; torch.ones((1, 1)).to("cuda") and then checking the GPU memory with nvidia-smi.
Some rest memory usage from buffers, intermediate results and some memory that can’t be used due to fragmentation
We’ll neglect these last two contributors as they are typically small and constant factors.
These items are stored as tensors which come in different shapes and precisions. The shapes are determined by hyper-parameters such as batch size, sequence length, model hidden dimensions, attention heads, vocabulary size, and potential model sharding as we’ll see later. Precision refers to formats like FP32, BF16, or FP8, which respectively require 4, 2, or 1 byte to store each single value in the tensor. We will have a full discussion of the different precisions and their trade-offs in the Mixed Precision Training section, for now let's just keep in mind that the memory requirements for these various format will be different and that will impact the memory usage of the items we need to store.

一般认为，模型的内存需求是可以精确计算的。然而，由于一些额外的内存占用因素，使得精确计算变得比较困难：

CUDA 内核通常会占用 1-2 GB 的 GPU 内存。你可以通过运行 `import torch; torch.ones（(1，1)).to（"cuda")`，然后使用 `nvidia-smi` 命令检查 GPU 内存使用情况来快速验证这一点。
此外，还有一些剩余内存来自于缓冲区、中间计算结果，以及由于内存碎片化而导致的无法使用的部分。
通常情况下，后两者的影响较小且相对固定，因此我们忽略不计。
这些内存对象以张量（tensor）的形式存储，而张量具有不同的形状和精度。张量的形状取决于超参数，例如批量大小（batch size）、序列长度（sequence length）、模型隐藏层维度、注意力头（attention heads）的数量、词汇表大小（vocabulary size），以及潜在的模型分片策略。精度则指的是诸如 FP32、BF16 或 FP8 等数据格式，它们分别需要 4、2 或 1 个字节来存储张量中的每个数值。我们将在「混合精度训练」章节中详细讨论不同精度格式及其优缺点。现在，我们只需要记住，不同数据格式对内存的需求是不同的，这将直接影响模型存储所需的总内存大小。

So how can I quickly determine memory usage from these variable? One simple way is to do this empirically and just measure it.

Profiling the memory usage
Using the Pytorch profiler we can understand how memory is allocated througho ut training. We can see that memory utilization is not a static thing but varies a lot during training and during a training step:

那么，如何快速确定这些变量的内存使用情况？ 一个简单的方法是通过实验测量。

分析内存使用情况通过 Pytorch profiler，我们可以了解训练过程中内存的分配情况。内存利用率并非一成不变，而是在训练以及训练步骤中动态变化：

Check out A1: Distributed Training Profiling for a walkthrough how to profile your model.
Clearly the first step looks very different from the subsequent ones, but let’s first have a look at the general anatomy of a step: first the activations increase quickly as we do the forward pass, then during the backward pass the gradients build up and as the backward pass propagates, the stored activations used to compute the gradients are progressively cleared. Finally, we perform the optimization step during which we need all the gradients and then update the optimizer states before we start the next forward pass.

请参考 A1：分布式训练分析，其中详细介绍了如何分析你的模型，进行性能剖析。
显然，训练过程的第一步与后续步骤存在显著差异。不过，我们首先来了解一下训练步骤的通常结构：首先，在前向传播过程中，激活值会迅速增加；然后在反向传播过程中，梯度会逐渐积累；随着反向传播的进行，用于计算梯度的激活值会被逐步清除。最后，执行优化步骤，这个步骤需要用到所有梯度，然后在开始下一次前向传播之前，需要更新优化器的状态。

Why does the first step looks different: the activations increase quickly and then plateau for a while. In this first step the torch cache allocator does a lot of preparation preparing memory allocations to speed up the subsequent steps so that they don’t require searching for free memory blocks afterwards (see Zach’s blog). After the first step we also see the optimizer states appearing which generally offset the memory usage for further training steps.

为什么第一步看起来有所不同：激活值快速增长，然后会有一段平稳期。在第一步中，torch 缓存分配器会进行大量的准备工作，预先分配内存，以便加速后续步骤。这样，后续步骤就不需要再搜索空闲内存块了 （参见 Zach 的博客）。在第一步之后，我们还可以看到优化器状态开始出现，这通常会平衡后续训练步骤中的内存使用量。

Ever noticed how sometimes the training succeeds in the first step but then OOMs during the following training steps? This can be explained by the build-up of the optimizer state after the first step.
Now that we’ve a first view of memory, let’s see how scaling up training is often a question of maximizing compute efficiency while keeping the memory requirements of these various items (activations, parameters, gradients, optimizer states) within the memory constraints of the GPUs.

你是否遇到过这样的情况：训练的第一步成功完成，但在后续步骤中却遭遇 OOM（Out Of Memory，内存溢出）错误？ 这通常是由于第一步之后，优化器状态不断累积造成的。

现在我们对内存已经有了一个初步的认识。接下来，让我们分析一下，如何扩大训练规模，通常就是在保证 GPU 内存限制的前提下，尽可能地提高计算效率，同时控制各项内容（激活值（activation）、参数、梯度以及优化器状态）的内存占用。

Weights/grads/optimizer states memory
Let's start with the first 3 items in our list: the model’s weights, gradients and optimizer states. We can actually pretty easily estimate the memory needed for them.

权重、梯度和优化器状态的内存占用让我们从这几个方面入手：模型的权重、梯度和优化器状态。我们可以相当容易地估算出它们各自所需的内存大小。

For a simple transformer LLM the number of parameters is given by the following formula:

$N = h * v + L * (12 * h^2 + 13 * h) + 2 * h$

对于一个简单的 Transformer 大语言模型（Large Language Model，LLM），其参数数量可以用以下公式计算：

$N = h * v + L *（12 * h^2 + 13 * h）+ 2 * h$

其中， *N* 代表参数总量，*h* 代表隐藏层大小（hidden size），*v* 代表词汇表大小（vocabulary size），*L* 代表层数（number of layers）。

We excluded the positional embedding count as we're not using fixed positional embeddings.

In that equation, h is the hidden dimension, v the vocabulary size, and L the number of layers in the model. Note that looking at the equation we can see that the term that will dominate at large hidden dimensions is the h^2 term since it’s the only one growing quadratically as we scale the parameters.

我们没有采用固定的位置嵌入，因此在计算参数量时，排除了位置嵌入的参数。

在上述公式中，h 代表隐藏层维度，v 代表词汇表大小，L 代表模型层数。观察公式可以发现，当隐藏层维度变得很大时，h^2 项会占据主导地位，因为它是唯一一个随着参数规模的扩大而呈平方级增长的项。

Memory requirements for the parameters and gradients are simply the number of parameters multiplied by the number of bytes per parameter. In good old-fashioned full precision (FP32) training both parameters and gradients require 4 bytes while the optimizer, if we use Adam, requires the momentum and variance to be stored, which adds another two 4 bytes per parameter. In summary:

参数和梯度的内存需求，本质上就是参数个数乘以每个参数所占用的字节数。在传统的全精度（FP32）训练中，参数和梯度各需要 4 个字节。如果我们使用 Adam 优化器，还需要为每个参数额外存储动量和方差这两个变量，这将增加 8 个字节 （每个变量 4 个字节）。总结如下：

$$
m_{params} = 4 * N \\
m_{grad} = 4 * N \\
m_{opt} = (4 + 4) * N
$$
​
Now let’s have look how things change if we use a lower precision. For stability reason (see the mixed-precision training section below) we often don't use full low precision training but a mix of higher and lower precision called "mixed precision"[2]. The default nowadays for mixed precision training is to generally use BF16 for most of the computations –requiring 2 bytes per parameter and gradient– as well as an additional copy of the model weights and gradients in FP32, thus 12 bytes per parameter in total. In addition to the parameters and gradient, we need to store the optimizer states: for the Adam optimizer, this requires the momentum and the variance usually stored in FP32 for numerical stability, each using 4 bytes.

$$
m_{params} = 4 * N \\
m_{grad} = 4 * N \\
m_{opt} =（4 + 4）* N
$$

接下来，我们来看看使用更低精度时会发生什么。出于稳定性的考虑（详见下文「混合精度训练」部分），我们通常不直接使用全低精度训练，而是采用一种高低精度混合的方式，即混合精度 [2]。混合精度训练是指在训练过程中，部分计算使用低精度，部分计算使用高精度。目前，混合精度训练的常见做法是： 大部分计算使用 BF16 格式（一种 16 位浮点数格式），每个参数和梯度需要 2 个字节。同时，为了保证精度，还会额外保存一份 FP32 格式（一种 32 位浮点数格式）的模型权重和梯度，这部分每个参数需要 4 个字节。因此，每个参数总共需要 12 个字节。除参数和梯度外，还需要存储优化器状态。以 Adam 优化器为例，它需要存储动量和方差这两个状态，通常使用 FP32 格式存储，以保证数值稳定性，每个状态占用 4 个字节。

See some more details below when we cover the ZeRO methods.
Here’s the summary:

$$
m_{params} = 2 * N \\
m_{grad} = 2 * N \\
m_{params\_fp32} = 4 * N \\
m_{opt} = (4 + 4) * N
$$
​
📝 Note

关于 ZeRO 方法的更多细节，请参考下面的内容。
摘要如下：

$$
m_{params} = 2 * N \\
m_{grad} = 2 * N \\
m_{params\_fp32} = 4 * N \\
m_{opt} =（4 + 4）* N
$$

📝 注意

Some libraries store grads in fp32 which would require an additional mparams_fp32 = 4∗N memory. This is done for example in nanotron, because bf16 is lossy for smaller values and we always prioritize stability. See this DeepSpeed issue for more information.

有些库会将梯度（grads）存储为 fp32 格式，这需要额外的 mparams_fp32 = 4∗N 内存空间。例如，在 Nanotron（一个用于训练大规模 Transformer 模型的库）中就是这样实现的，因为对于较小的值，使用 bf16 格式会造成信息损失（lossy），而我们始终将稳定性放在首位。更多信息请参考 DeepSpeed issue。

📝 Note

The FP32 copy of parameters (mparams_fp32) is sometimes called "master weights" in the literature and codebases.

FP32 格式的参数副本（mparams_fp32），在一些文献和代码库中也被称为 ** 主权重（master weights)**。

Interestingly, mixed precision itself doesn’t save overall memory as it just distributes the memory differently across the three components, and in fact adds another 4 bytes over full precision training if we accumulate gradients in FP32. It’s still advantageous as computing the forward/backward passes in half precision allows us to (1) use optimized lower precision operations on the GPU which are faster and (2) reduces the activation memory requirements during the forward pass which is a large part of the memory usage as we saw on the graph above and below.

有趣的是，混合精度本身并不能节省总体内存，它只是将内存以不同的方式分配到三个组成部分中。如果我们在 FP32（32-bit Floating Point）中累积梯度，相比于全精度训练，实际上还会额外增加 4 个字节的内存占用。尽管如此，混合精度仍然具有优势，因为它允许我们使用半精度来计算前向和后向传递。这样做有两点好处：(1）可以在 GPU（Graphics Processing Unit）上使用优化的、精度更低的操作，从而提高计算速度；(2）降低前向传递过程中的激活内存需求。激活内存是内存消耗的重要组成部分。

Let’s get a sense of how much general memory we need for a model (full and mixed precision giving the same overall value):

| Model parameters | FP32 or BF16 w/o FP32 grad acc | BF16 w/ FP32 grad acc |
|---|---|---|
| 1B | 16 GB | 20 GB |
| 7B | 112 GB | 140 GB |
| 70B | 1120 GB | 1400 GB |
| 405B | 6480 GB | 8100 GB |

为了解模型所需的通用内存大小（在全精度和混合精度下，总体需求相同）：

| 模型参数 | 没有 FP32（单精度浮点数）梯度累积的 FP32 或 BF16（Brain Floating Point，一种降低精度的浮点数格式）| 具有 FP32（单精度浮点数）梯度累积的 BF16（Brain Floating Point，一种降低精度的浮点数格式）|
|---|---|---|
| 1B | 16 GB | 20 GB |
| 7B | 112 GB | 140 GB |
| 70B | 1120 GB | 1400 GB |
| 405B | 6480 GB | 8100 GB |

Using FP8 training instead of BF16 would further decrease the memory usage but it is less stable and a very active research topic (see this tweet) and we’ll cover it in more detail later.

使用 FP8 训练代替 BF16 训练，虽然能够进一步降低内存占用，但 FP8 训练的稳定性较差，并且还是一个非常热门的研究领域（参见这条推文）。我们将在后续内容中更详细地介绍 FP8。

As we can see, as soon as we reach 7B (!), weights and optimizer requirements already starts to add up significantly and exceed the size of a typical GPU memory, e.g. 80GB for a H100 GPU.

正如我们所看到的，一旦模型参数达到 70 亿（!），权重和优化器所需要的存储空间就会迅速增长，甚至超过了常见 GPU 的内存容量，比如 H100 GPU 的显存是 80GB。

But for now, let’s start with models which still fits in a single GPU, take a look at the last big contributor to our memory budget: the activation memory.

Activations memory
Activation memory is a bit more complex to compute than the weights, gradients and optimizer states, in part because it depends on the inputs of the model. If you’re unsure why we even need to store activations for the backward pass, this reference is a good quick refresh. After a careful inspection of how backward pass is computed we can estimate the total memory required for the activations in mixed precision and we arrive at the following equation:

但现在，让我们从能够运行在单张 GPU 上的模型开始，看看占用内存的主要部分：激活内存（Activation Memory）。

激活内存激活内存的计算比权重、梯度和优化器状态要复杂一些，部分原因是它取决于模型的输入。如果您不确定为什么我们需要为反向传播存储激活，可以参考该资料快速回顾。仔细分析反向传播的计算过程后，我们可以估计混合精度下激活所需要的内存总量，可以得到如下公式：

$m_{act} = L \cdot seq \cdot bs \cdot h \cdot (34 + \frac{5 \cdot n_{heads} \cdot seq}{h})$

Here L is the number of layers, seq the sequence length, bs the batch size in samples, h the hidden dimension of the model and nheads the number of heads.

$m_{act} = L \cdot seq \cdot bs \cdot h \cdot（34 + \frac {5 \cdot n_{heads} \cdot seq}{h})$

这里 L 是层数，seq 是序列长度，bs 是批大小（batch size）（以样本为单位），h 是模型的隐藏维度，nheads 是注意力头数。

For the exact derivation of the numbers, you can follow this original NVIDIA paper on recomputation 
[3], it essentially requires you to do some accounting of all the sizes of intermediate activations between each operation in a transformer layer.

要精确计算这些数值，你可以参考 NVIDIA 关于重计算技术 [3] 的原始论文。本质上，你需要计算 Transformer 层中各操作之间所有中间激活（activation）的尺寸。

An interesting observation here is how the memory is not static for a given model but it scales linearly with both the sequence length and batch size. This means the activation memory is the part which will blow up when we increase our batch size or train with longer sequences. We can use this equation to look at how memory usage changes for various sequence lengths for example for Llama models (bs=1):

一个有趣的现象是，对于特定模型而言，内存并非固定不变，而是随着序列长度和批次大小的增加呈线性增长。这意味着激活内存是当增加批次大小或使用更长序列训练时，内存消耗显著增加的部分。我们可以利用这个公式来了解不同序列长度下 Llama 模型（批次大小 bs=1）的内存使用情况变化：

This graph tells a striking story: for short sequences (or similar for small batch-sizes), activations are almost negligible, but starting at around 2-4k tokens they come to take a significant amount of memory while parameter, gradient and optimizer states usage (that we’ll discuss later) stays roughly independent of the sequence length and batch size.

这个图表讲述了一个引人注目的故事：对于短序列（或者小批量大小的情况类似），激活占用的内存非常小，但当序列长度达到 2-4k 个 Token 左右时，激活占用的内存就会显著增加。而参数、梯度和优化器状态的使用情况（我们将在后续章节讨论）则基本不受序列长度和批量大小的影响。

For large input tokens (a.k.a large batch-sizes/sequences), activations become by far the largest memory burden.

Is there a way to tame this “activation explosion”? Good question, reader!

对于较大的输入 Token（Token）(也称为大批量 / 长序列），激活值是目前为止最大的内存开销。

有没有什么方法可以缓解这种「激活值爆炸」？ 读者朋友，问得好！

It’s time to explain our first technique – called activation recomputation– which will help us cap activation memory footprint. An essential tool in today’s large model training toolbox.

现在，让我们来介绍第一种技术 —— 激活重计算（activation recomputation）—— 它可以帮助我们有效控制激活内存的占用。这也是当前大型模型训练中不可或缺的重要手段。

Activation recomputation
The general idea behind activation recomputation – also called gradient checkpointing or rematerialization – is to discard some activations during the forward pass to save memory and spend some extra compute to recompute these on the fly during the backward pass. Without recomputation, we store every hidden state between two learnable operations (e.g. feed-forward, layernorm etc.), such that we can use them during the backward pass to compute gradients. When we use recomputation we typically will only store activations at a few key points along the model architecture, discard the rest of activations and recompute them on the fly during the backward pass from the nearest saved activations, basically performing again a sub-part of the forward pass to trade of memory for compute. It generally looks like this:

激活重计算激活重计算（Activation recomputation）—— 也称为梯度检查点（gradient checkpointing）或重物化（rematerialization）—— 的核心思想是在前向传播过程中丢弃部分激活值，以此节省内存；然后在反向传播时，通过额外的计算来重新生成这些激活值。在不使用重计算的情况下，我们需要存储两个可学习操作（例如前馈、layernorm 等）之间的所有隐藏状态，以便在反向传播时计算梯度。而使用重计算时，通常只在模型的关键位置存储激活值，其余的激活值则会被丢弃。在反向传播过程中，从最近的已保存激活值出发，重新计算被丢弃的激活值，本质上是用计算资源换取内存空间。其原理大致如下：

Hover over the network elements to see their details
There are several strategies to select key activations to store:

Full: We checkpoint activations at the transition point between each layer of the Transformer model. This is usually called the full strategy since it requires a forward pass through each layer essentially adding a full forward pass during the backward pass. This strategy saves the most memory but is the most expensive one in terms of compute. It generally increases the compute cost and time by up to 30-40% which is very noticeable.
Selective: In general we can do better than full. The authors of the recomputation paper
[3]
 did a detailed analysis studying which activations grow the largest and have the cheapest recomputation cost in terms of FLOPs. Turns out that the attention computations fall in that category, and thus we can usually discard them and focus on checkpointing expensive the feedforward computations. For a GPT-3 (175B) model this means 70% activation memory reduction at a 2.7% compute cost.
In recent models like DeepSeek V3, selective checkpointing is performed, storing even a smaller size of attention activation —using so-called “Multi-Head Latent Attention” (MLA)– to optimize activation memory usage.
Let’s see how drastically recomputation strategies can in practice reduce the memory footprint and how selective recomputation strikes a nice balance between memory saving and recomputation cost:

将鼠标悬停在网络元素上，即可查看其详细信息。

以下是几种选择要存储的关键激活值的策略：

Full（完整)： 我们在 Transformer 模型的每一层之间的过渡点进行激活值检查点（Checkpoint）设置。这通常被称为「完整」策略，因为它需要对每一层进行正向传播，本质上相当于在反向传播过程中增加了一次完整的正向传播。这种策略最节省内存，但计算开销也最大。它通常会使计算成本和时间增加 30-40% 左右，这是一个非常显著的开销。
Selective（选择性)： 一般来说，我们可以做得比「完整」策略更好。在重计算相关的论文 [3] 中，作者进行了一项详细的分析，研究了哪些激活值增长幅度最大，并且在浮点运算次数（FLOPs）方面重计算成本最低。结果表明，注意力（Attention）计算属于这一类别，因此我们通常可以忽略它们，而专注于对计算量大的前馈（Feedforward）计算进行检查点设置。对于 GPT-3（175B）模型来说，这意味着以 2.7% 的计算成本为代价，减少 70% 的激活内存。
在像 DeepSeek V3 这样最新的模型中，采用了选择性检查点策略，甚至存储更小尺寸的注意力激活值 —— 使用所谓的「多头隐式注意力」(Multi-Head Latent Attention，MLA)—— 来优化激活内存的使用。
接下来，让我们看看重计算策略在实践中如何大幅减少内存占用，以及选择性重计算如何在内存节省和重计算成本之间实现良好的平衡：

Another trend that's clearly visibile here is how the activations for long sequences play a bigger role for smaller models, so the effect of recomputation becomes even more noticeable.

这里另一个清晰可见的趋势是，长序列的激活（activations）对较小的模型影响更大，因此重计算（recomputation）带来的提升也更为显著。

📝 Note

When you’re measuring how efficient your training setup is at using your GPU/TPU/accelerator, you usually want to take recomputation into account to compute total FLOPS (Floating point operations per second) and compare it to theoretical maximum FLOPS of the GPU/TPU/accelerator. Taking recomputation into account when calculating FLOPS for a training step gives a value called “hardware FLOPS” which is the real number of operations performed on the accelerator. Dividing this number by the duration of the training step and the maximum accelerator FLOPS yields the Hardware FLOPS Utilization (HFU).

当评估训练配置在使用 GPU、TPU 或其他加速器时的效率时，通常需要考虑重计算，以便计算总的 FLOPS（Floating-point Operations Per Second，每秒浮点运算次数），并将其与 GPU、TPU 或加速器的理论最大 FLOPS 进行比较。在计算训练步骤的 FLOPS 时，考虑重计算会得到一个称为「硬件 FLOPS」的值，它代表加速器上实际执行的运算次数。将该数值除以训练步骤的持续时间以及加速器的最大 FLOPS，即可得到硬件 FLOPS 利用率（Hardware FLOPS Utilization，HFU）。

However, what really matters at the end of the day is the start-to-end time needed to train a model on a given dataset. So when comparing various GPU/TPU/accelerator together, if one of these accelerator provide for instance enough memory to skip recomputation and thus perform less operation per second (lower HFU) but for a faster training, it should be rewarded not punished. Thus, an alternative is to compute what is called Model FLOPS Utilization (MFU) which, in contrast to HFU, only takes into account the required operations for the forward+backward passes through the model, and do not include recomputation in the measured FLOPs. This value is thus more specific to the model than the training implementation.

然而，最终真正重要的是在给定数据集上训练模型所需的总耗时。因此，当比较各种 GPU、TPU 和其他加速器时，如果某个加速器能够提供足够的内存来跳过重计算，从而降低每秒执行的操作数（较低的 HFU），但能实现更快的训练，那么它应该得到奖励，而不是受到不利评价。因此，另一种评估方法是计算所谓的模型 FLOPS 利用率（MFU）(Floating Point Operations Per Second，每秒浮点运算次数）。与 HFU 相比，MFU 仅考虑模型的前向和后向计算所需的运算，不包括测量 FLOP 中的重计算。因此，MFU 比训练的具体实现更能反映模型本身的效率。

Most training frameworks these days use FlashAttention (that we cover further below) which integrate natively activation recomputation in its optimization strategy by recomputing attention scores and matrices in the backward pass instead of storing them. Thus most people using Flash Attention are already making use of selective recomputation.

现在，大多数训练框架都采用了 FlashAttention（我们将在下文详细介绍）。FlashAttention 在优化过程中，通过在反向传播阶段重新计算注意力分数和矩阵，而非直接存储这些数据，原生集成了激活值重计算。因此，大多数使用 FlashAttention 的用户实际上已经在使用选择性重计算了。

As you’ve now understood, activation recomputation increases the number of FLOPs slightly due to recomputation, while it significantly reduces memory access overhead.

正如您现在所了解的，激活重计算（activation recomputation）因为需要重新计算，会略微增加 FLOPs，但同时能显著降低内存访问的开销。

This trade-off is particularly advantageous on hardware with small high-speed memory, like GPUs, as accessing memory is typically slower than performing computations. Despite the additional operations involves, the overall effect is thus often faster computation as well, in addition to the much lower memory footprint.

这种权衡 —— 即增加计算量来减少内存占用 —— 在配备小型高速内存的硬件上，例如 GPU，尤其具有优势，因为访问内存的速度通常比进行计算要慢。尽管增加了一些额外的操作，但最终的效果通常是计算速度更快，同时内存占用也更低。

Now that we’ve learned about recomputation, we can tame the activations memory usage as we saw in the above graphs!

However, activations still bears a linear dependance on the batch size and all our profiles in the barplots above were using bs=1 so as we move to larger batch sizes it might become an issue again. Do not despair as we have a second tool in our box - gradient accumulation to the rescue!

既然我们已经了解了重计算，我们就可以控制激活的内存使用，正如我们在上面的图表中看到的！

然而，激活内存占用仍然与批大小呈线性关系，并且我们上面条形图中的所有配置都使用了 bs=1，因此当我们使用更大的批大小时，它可能会再次成为问题。别担心，我们还有第二个法宝 —— 梯度累积！

Gradient accumulation
Gradient accumulation is a very straightforward method to avoid memory explosion which consists in splitting our batch into micro-batches. We'll perform forward and backward passes successively on each micro-batch, compute the gradients, and, as the name suggests, sum the gradients of all micro-batch before we perform an optimizer step. In practice, the optimization step is conducted not on the sum but on the average of the gradients, so that the result is independent of the number of gradient accumulation steps.

梯度累积梯度累积是一种非常直接的策略，用于避免内存溢出。其核心思想是将一个大的训练批次拆分成若干个小的微批次（micro-batches）。对于每一个微批次，我们依次执行前向传播和反向传播，计算得到梯度。顾名思义，梯度累积会将所有微批次的梯度进行累加，然后在执行优化器更新参数。实际上，优化器使用的并非梯度的总和，而是梯度的平均值，这样可以保证结果与梯度累积的次数无关。

Let’s call the batch size for each forward pass the micro batch size (mbs). We’ll refer to the overall batch size between each optimizer step as the global batch size (gbs). If we do one optimizer step for each 8 forward/backward passes, the global batch size will be 8 times the micro batch size.

我们将每次前向传播的批次大小定义为微批次大小（micro batch size，mbs）。而每次优化器更新所使用的总批次大小，我们称之为全局批次大小（global batch size，gbs）。如果每完成 8 次前向 / 反向传播后进行一次优化器更新，那么全局批次大小就是微批次大小的 8 倍。

What we now call global batch size thus corresponds to what we’ve called up to now just batch size for simplicity (we now make our terms more precise to avoid ambiguity).

我们现在所说的全局批次大小，对应于我们之前为了简单起见而直接称呼的批次大小（为了避免歧义，我们现在对术语进行了更精确的定义）。

With gradient accumulation the global batch size can be simply computed as follows:

bs=gbs=mbs×grad_acc

通过梯度累积，我们可以这样简单计算全局批大小：

bs=gbs=mbs×grad_acc

Gradient accumulation allows us to effectively increase our batch size up to infinity (and beyond!) while the memory footprint stays constant. Gradient accumulation is also compatible with activation recomputation for further memory reduction.

梯度累积允许我们有效地增大训练时的批量大小，使其接近无限大，同时内存占用保持不变。梯度累积也与激活值重计算技术兼容，可以进一步降低内存需求。

Using gradient accumulation means we need to keep buffers where we accumulate gradients which persist throughout a training step. Whereas without gradient accumulation, in the backward gradients are computed while freeing the activations memory, which means a lower peak memory.
Gradient accumulation allows us to reduce memory of activations which grow linearly with batch size by computing only only partial, micro-batches.

使用梯度累积意味着我们需要维护缓冲区来累积梯度，这些梯度会在整个训练步骤中持续存在。然而，如果没有梯度累积，在 backward 过程中，梯度计算的同时会释放激活内存，这意味着更低的峰值内存。
梯度累积允许我们通过仅计算部分微批量来减少激活内存的使用，这些激活内存会随着批量大小线性增长。

One drawback however, is that gradient accumulation requires multiple consecutive forward/backward passes per optimization step thereby increasing the compute overhead and slowing down training. No free lunch!

然而，一个缺点是，梯度累积需要在每个优化步骤执行多次连续的正向和反向传播，这增加了计算负担，降低了训练速度。正如俗话所说，没有免费的午餐！

But if you’ve carefully followed, you probably noticed that the forward/backward passes for each micro-batch can actually be run in parallel. Forward/backward passes are independent from each other, with independent input samples being the only difference. Seems like it’s time to start extending our training to more than one GPU!

但是，如果您仔细阅读了以上内容，您可能会注意到，对于每个微批次（micro-batch）的前向传播 / 反向传播实际上可以并行运行。前向传播 / 反向传播彼此独立，唯一的区别是独立的输入样本。看来现在可以将训练扩展到多个 GPU 上了！

Before that, let's quickly see how we can vizualise computation and communication with a short tour of one of the most usefull tool in the distributed training toolbox: the profiler. This tool will be extremely usefull to understand and validate how communications between GPUs and compute are happening and where bottlenecks are.

在此之前，我们先快速了解如何可视化计算和通信，这里将介绍分布式训练工具箱中最有用的工具之一：Profiler（性能分析器，Profiler）。Profiler 对于理解和验证 GPU 之间的通信和计算过程，以及定位性能瓶颈至关重要。

Profiling GPU compute and communication
PyTorch's profiler allows us to trace and visualize exactly what's happening on both CPU and GPU during training. It's natively integrated in PyTorch. Let's see how to use it:

分析 GPU 计算和通信

PyTorch 自带性能分析器（profiler），它可以帮助我们追踪并可视化训练过程中 CPU 和 GPU 上的活动。该工具已原生集成在 PyTorch 中。下面，我们来看看如何使用它：

with torch.profiler.profile(
    activities=[
        torch.profiler.ProfilerActivity.CPU,
        torch.profiler.ProfilerActivity.CUDA,
    ],
    schedule=torch.profiler.schedule(wait=1, warmup=1, active=3),
    on_trace_ready=torch.profiler.tensorboard_trace_handler('./log/profile'),
    with_stack=True
) as prof:
    for step in range(steps):
        train_step() 
        prof.step()

使用 `torch.profiler.profile` 函数进行性能分析，配置如下：

```python
with torch.profiler.profile（
  activities=[
    torch.profiler.ProfilerActivity.CPU， # CPU 活动
    torch.profiler.ProfilerActivity.CUDA，# CUDA 活动
  ],
  schedule=torch.profiler.schedule（wait=1，warmup=1，active=3),
  on_trace_ready=torch.profiler.tensorboard_trace_handler（'./log/profile'),
  with_stack=True
）as prof:
  for step in range（steps):
    train_step（)
    prof.step（)
```在这个代码片段中，我们首先定义了性能分析的活动类型，包括 CPU 活动（CPU activity）和 CUDA 活动（CUDA activity）。`schedule`参数定义了性能分析的步骤，这里设置了等待 1 步，预热 1 步，然后激活分析 3 步。分析结果会通过`tensorboard_trace_handler`保存到`./log/profile`目录下，以便后续使用 TensorBoard 进行可视化分析。在循环中，`train_step（)`函数执行训练步骤，`prof.step（)` 用于推进性能分析器到下一步。

This generates a trace that we can visualize in TensorBoard or Chrome's trace viewer. The trace shows:

CPU thread launching kernels asynchronously to GPU
Multiple CUDA streams handling compute and communication in parallel
Kernel execution times and memory allocation
profile_trace_annotated.png

这段代码会生成一个跟踪数据，我们可以在 TensorBoard 或 Chrome 的跟踪查看器中进行可视化。这个跟踪数据展示了以下信息：

*  CPU 线程异步地将内核（Kernel）启动到 GPU
*  多个 CUDA 流（CUDA streams）并行地处理计算和通信任务
*  内核执行的具体时间和内存分配情况

profile_trace_annotated.png

Example trace showing CPU thread launching kernels asynchronously to GPU, with compute kernels and communication happening in parallel across different CUDA streams

Example trace showing CPU thread launching kernels asynchronously to GPU，with compute kernels and communication happening in parallel across different CUDA streams

示例跟踪展示了 CPU 线程如何异步地将内核（kernel）启动到 GPU 上，使得计算内核和通信能够在不同的 CUDA 流（CUDA stream）中并行执行。

The trace helps identify bottlenecks like:

Sequential compute and communication that could be overlapped
Idle GPU time waiting for data transfers
Memory movement between CPU and GPU
Kernel launch overhead from CPU
Understanding these patterns is crucial for optimizing distributed training performance. For example, the trace would clearly show if gradient synchronization is properly overlapped with backward computation as we'll discuss later.

跟踪有助于识别瓶颈，例如：

可以并行处理的串行计算和通信因等待数据传输而闲置的 GPU 时间
CPU 和 GPU 之间的内存数据移动由 CPU 引起的内核启动开销理解这些模式对于优化分布式训练的性能至关重要。例如，跟踪可以清晰地展示梯度同步是否与反向计算充分并行，我们将在后文讨论这一点。

Now let’s get a larger workstation 🖥️ with a couple of GPUs and start investigating our first scaling technique called data parallelism which –as we'll see– is just a parallel version of gradient accumulation.

现在，让我们配置一台配备多个 GPU 的更强大的工作站 🖥️，并开始研究我们的第一个扩展技术，即数据并行（data parallelism）。正如我们稍后会看到的，它本质上是梯度累积（gradient accumulation）的一种并行实现。



### Data Parallelism

To add a podcast feeling to your reading experience, feel free to listen to the NotebookLM hosts discussing the following sections of this book as you're reading along.

The idea behind data parallelism (DP) is to replicate the model on several GPUs (we call the replica's “model instances”) and run forward and backward passes on different micro batches of data in parallel for each GPU, hence the name Data Parallelism. You've probably already seen Data Parallelism in simple training examples but as you'll soon see we'll dive quite deeper in this section so stay tuned even if you know the general approach.

image.png

If you are not familiar with distributed communications patterns like broadcast, gather or all-reduce we put together a small crash course in A0: Parallel Programming Crash Course.
Using a different micro batch for each GPU means we’ll have different gradients in each GPU, so to keep the model instances in sync across different GPUs, the gradients from the model instances will be averaged using an operation called “all-reduce”, which happens during the backward pass, before the optimizer step.

This involves our first “distributed communication” primitive: all-reduce which handles the synchronization and communication between GPU instances and nodes.

image.png

A naive DP implementation would just wait for the backward pass the finish so that we have all gradients, then it triggers an all-reduce over all DP ranks, to sync these gradients. But such an sequential steps of computation followed by communication is A BIG NO! Because we don’t want our GPUs to stay idle while communication is happening, like on the above graph.

Instead we should try to overlap communication and computation whenever possible so that they happen at the same time as much as possible.

Let’s see three optimizations that allow us to do much better than our naive first implementation!

First optimization: Overlap gradient synchronization with backward pass
The main drawback of the naive DDP approach we’ve just described is that after the backward pass (computation), we have to wait for gradient synchronization (communication) before updating the parameters. Could we overlap this communication with our computation? The answer is yes!

As shown in the figure above, the gradients (red boxes) for a layer can be gathered and summed even before the gradients from earlier layers (red boxes to the left) have been computed. For example, as soon as the backward pass of the last layer is complete (last box on the right), those gradients can already be gathered and summed while the backward computations continue for earlier layers, moving toward the left.

image.png

This can be achieved in pytorch by attaching an all-reduce hook function to each parameter. An all-reduce operation is triggered as soon as the gradient for that parameter is ready, while gradients for other parameters are still being computed. This approach overlaps most of the all-reduce operations with gradient calculations, thereby improving efficiency. Here's a simple function to attach a hook:

def register_backward_hook(self, hook):
    """
    Registers a backward hook for all parameters of the model that 
    require gradients.
    """
    for p in self.module.parameters():
        if p.requires_grad is True:
            p.register_post_accumulate_grad_hook(hook)
Overlapping computation and communication reduces the time spent waiting for gradient synchronization across the entire model. Gradient synchronization can occur (at least partially) in parallel with backward pass, significantly speeding up data parallelism. Here's a full implementation of naive DP with synchronization overlap:

This is our first example of “overlapping computation and communication” which we will discuss several times in this blog post and is an essential technique to maximal scaling efficiency. But we can improve the efficiency even further!

Second optimization: Bucketing gradients
GPU operations are usually more efficient when performed on large tensors rather than having many operations running on smaller tensors. This is also true for communication operations. Thus, we can advantageously group gradients into buckets and launch a single all-reduce for all the gradients within the same bucket instead of performing independent all-reduce for each gradient. It will generally look like the following:

dp_overlap3.svg

Think of it like packing items into boxes before shipping. It's more efficient to send a few big boxes than many small ones. By performing a single all-reduce operation for each bucket, we can significantly reduce communication overhead and speed up the communication operation.

Here's a code implementation with bucketing:

Third optimization: Interplay with gradient accumulation
Finally, as we’ve seen before, gradient accumulation works by performing multiple forward and backward passes before updating the parameters with optimizer.step(). When combining gradient accumulation with data parallelism, we should be careful when we want to synchronize gradients.

In a naive version, an all-reduce operation is automatically triggered after each backward pass during the accumulation, which is sub-optimal as a single reduce after the final step would have the same effect while reducing overhead.

In PyTorch, this is typically solved by adding a model.no_sync() decorator, which disables gradient synchronization, on the backward passes which don’t need reduction.

📝 Note

When performing communication operations, tensors must be contiguous in memory to avoid redundant memory copies. To perform this optimally, we often pre-allocate continuous buffers of the size of activations or model parameters specifically for communication. While this speed up communication, it also contributes in part to the peak memory usage during training.

Now let's have a look what that means for the global batch size.

Revisit global batch size
We can update our batch size equation with our newly added Data Parallelism and Gradient Accumulation parameters:

b
s
=
g
b
s
=
m
b
s
×
g

Here 
g
r
a
d
_
a
c
c
grad_acc is the number of gradient accumulation steps and 
d
p
dp is the number of parallel instances used for data parallelism.

Given a targeted global batch size, we can thus trade gradient accumulation steps for data-parallel processes to speed up training.

In practice, people tend to maximize the number of data-parallel nodes (DP) over gradient accumulation as much as possible since it's inherently parallel, unlike the sequential nature of gradient accumulation. Gradient accumulation is then added on top of data parallelism to achieve the target global batch size when scaling data parallelism alone is not sufficient before you run out of GPUs.

A good resource for further reading on Data Parallelism is https://siboehm.com/articles/22/data-parallel-training.
Being able to distribute the training over different samples gives us a first dimension of parallelization, thus making this 1D parallelism (we’ll progressively cover 4 more dimensions).

Our journey up to now
Let’s quickly summarize how to setup our first 1D parallel training with a draft recipe for an optimal data-parallel setup:

We should first determine the best (global) batch size in tokens (GBST) either by consulting literature or running experiments measuring model convergence.
We then select a sequence length for training, again by either consulting literature or running experiments. Generally, 2-8k tokens work reliably well for the evaluations we have today (we won’t dive in training recipes here but teams usually increase the sequence at the end of the training, adding some longer-context data samples in the mix to reach the longer context size of today).
We now know the batch size (gbs). We can find the maximum local batch size (mbs) on a single GPU by increasing the local batch size until we run out of memory.
Finally, we determine the number of available GPUs for our target DP. The ratio of GBS to DP gives us the remaining number of gradient accumulation steps needed for the desired GBS.
For instance DeepSeek and Llama models are trained with a 4k tokens sequence length during the main pretraining phase.

The reason 2-8k work well for pretraining is that documents that are longer are very rare on the web. See Harm’s blogpost for a detailed analysis.
If the gradient accumulation ratio is lower than one, i.e. we have too many GPUs a.k.a GPU-rich 🤑 (!), we can either choose to not use all our GPUs, explore a larger global batch size or test if a lower MBS will speed up training. In the latter case we’ll end up prioritizing throughput over individual GPU compute efficiency, using a smaller MBS than possible in order to speed up training.

Time to take a concrete example: Let’s say we want to train a recent model with a GBS of 4M tokens and a sequence length of 4k. Our batch size will thus be 1024 samples (we pick the closest powers of two). Let's assume we observe that a single GPU can only fit MBS=2 in memory and we have 128 GPUs available for training. This means with 4 gradient accumulation steps we’ll achieve our goal of 1024 samples or 4M tokens per training step. Now what if we suddenly have 512 GPUs available? We can achieve the same GBS and thus identical training by keeping MBS=2 and setting gradient accumulation steps to 1 and achieve faster training!

📝 Note

Bear in mind that at the 512+ GPUs scale, depending on the network used, the communication operations will start to be bound by ring latency (time required for a signal to propagate once around the ring) which means we can no longer fully overlap the DP communications. This will decrease our compute efficiency and hit our throughput. In this case we should start exploring other dimensions to parallelize on.

While data parallelism nicely overlaps the all-reduce gradient synchronization with backward computation to save time, this benefit starts to break down at large scales. Why? Because as we add more and more GPUs (hundreds or thousands), the overhead of coordinating between them grows significantly and the network requirements are becoming too large for the benefits. As a result, our setup will become less and less efficient which each additional GPU we add to the system.

Lets see this happening in practice with some benchmark:

We see that above some limit, our throughput starts to drop quite significantly while the memory usage per GPU stays constant and is not affected by adding more DP ranks.

Data parallelism was our first (simple) strategy to scale training across more GPUs. This technique works like gradient accumulation but parallelizes the forward and backward passes on micro batches, thus increasing throughput!

The keen reader has already probably noted however that this assumes that we can fit at least one input sample forward pass (mbs=1) into our GPU memory. This is not always the case! As we can see, larger models don’t fit into a single GPU, even with activation recomputation activated:

Tip: you can quickly eyeball the minimal memory required for your model’s parameters by multiplying by 2 e.g. 70B → 140GB (=133GiB)
We've also seen that Data Parallelism starts to have some limiting communication overhead above a certain level of scaling. Do we have other options for these larger models or large batch-size? We do have some solutions thankfully. They will involve either move some tensors to the CPU or split the weights/gradients/optimizer-states tensors across GPUs devices! Let's start diving in them.

There are two main approaches to splitting: parallelism (tensor, context, or pipeline parallelism) and sharing (DeepSpeed Zero or PyTorch FSDP). Both approaches are somewhat orthogonal and can actually be combined!

The sharing paradigm is closely related to DP so we’ll have a look at it first by investigating the ZeRO method!

ZeRO (Zero Redundancy Optimizer)
In this section we will introduce DeepSpeed ZeRO (Zero Redundancy Optimizer), a memory optimization technology designed to reduce memory redundancies in LLM training.

While Data Parallelism is an efficient way to scale training, the naive replication of optimizer states, gradients, and parameters across each DP rank introduces a significant memory redundancy. ZeRO eliminates memory redundancy by partitioning the optimizer states, gradients, and parameters across the data parallel dimension, while still allowing computation with the full set of parameters. This sometimes requires more communications between DP ranks which may or may not be fully overlapped as we’ll see next!

We’ll focus on ZeRO-1 to ZeRO-3 in this blog as it should give a broad view on how it helps reduce memory while showing the tradeoffs to take into account. You can find more ZeRO flavors in the DeepSpeed docs.
This approach is organized into three possible optimization stage of ZeRO:

ZeRO-1: optimizer state partitioning
ZeRO-2: optimizer state + gradient partitioning
ZeRO-3 (also called FSDP for “Fully-Sharded Data Parallelism”): optimizer state + gradient + parameter partitioning
When we say partitioning, it means along the DP axis, as ZeRO is part of Data Parallelism. We’ll see later that we can partition along other axes.
You might be missing the activations among the things we can shard. Since each DP replica of the model receives a different micro-batch the activations on each DP rank also differ so they are not duplicated and thus can’t be sharded!

Let’s have a closer look how much we can save with the partitioning of each ZeRO stage!

Memory usage revisited
You likely remember from our previous section the memory usage of optimizer states, gradients, and parameters during a standard training. Lets call our model's parameters count 
Ψ
Ψ (previously N but here we use the original ZeRO paper notation). In Mixed Precision Training (more details in a later section) with the Adam optimizer, the memory usage for each item we need to store is:

Model’s parameters (half precision i.e. bf16/fp16): 
2
Ψ
2Ψ
Model’s gradients (half precision i.e. bf16/fp16): 
2

Model’s parameters in fp32 and optimizer states:

Model’s gradients in fp32:

4Ψ (optional, only accounted if we want to accumulate grads in fp32)
If we don’t accumulate gradients in fp32 this gives us a total memory consumption of

2Ψ+6Ψ+12Ψ. Let’s focus for now on the case without fp32 gradient accumulation for simplicity but you can just add the additional bytes to the gradient term which are affected by ZeRO-2 and 3.

The idea of ZeRO is to shard these objects across the DP ranks, each node only storing a slice of the items which are reconstructed when and if needed, thereby dividing memory usage by the data parallel degree

Let’s explain this graph and it’s values by exploring how each ZeRO stage works. We’ll start with ZeRO-1.

ZeRO-1: Partitioning Optimizer States
In vanilla DP, all ranks gather the same gradients after the backward pass and simultaneously perform identical optimizer steps. This seems like a lot of duplicated work. Can we avoid it and reduce memory usage at the same time?

In ZeRO-1, the optimizer states are partitioned into 
N
d
N 
d
​
  equal parts where 
N

N

  is the DP degree. This means that each model replica distributed on each DP rank only keeps track of

  of the optimizer states. During the optimization step only

However during the forward pass, each replica need all the parameters, we thus need to add an additional all-gather (the second type of collective communication primitive we encounter!) after the optimizer step so that each model replica has the full set of updated weights.

This explains the memory formula of

  that we saw on the above graph! Here’s a summary of the sequence of operations for a single training step

Backward pass with the same, full set of gradients on each replica, but different microbatches across replicas
Perform an reduce-scatter on the gradients (we'll explain the reduce-scatter primitive in the graph below)

Perform an all-gather among the bf16 parameters to send missing slices back to each replica. This is a new operation in ZeRO, and not used in vanilla DP.
Note: reduce-scatter is 2 times faster than all reduce! Yay, a third communication primitive!
You may be wondering what is this "reduce-scatter" operation and how this all look so lets try to make this more graphical with the figure below. We'll go over all the steps of a forward/backward pass cycle:

dp_zero1.gif

In terms of practical communications, compared to vanilla DP, Zero-1 change our "all-reduce" gradient communication to a "reduce-scatter" operation and adds an all-gather operation over all parameters after the optimizer step. Here is how it looks:

dp_zero1_overlap.svg

If you've been following along, you'll recall from vanilla DP that we can overlap the all-reduce gradient communication with the backward pass computation. In ZeRO-1, we can also investigate how to efficiently overlap the newly added all-gather of bf16 parameters. There are two main strategies for this:

During optimizer step: We can initiate the all-gather immediately after the optimizer updates part of the parameters. This allows the communication to potentially overlap with other parameters update.
During forward: We can overlap the all-gather of each layer’s parameters with the forward pass.
📝 Note

Unfortunately these techniques are not straightforward to implement and require sophisticated use of hooks/bucketing. In practice we can just use PyTorch native ZeRO-3/FSDP implementation and set the FSDPUnit to be the entire model, more details about this later.

In ZeRO-1 the optimizer states have been partitioned, which means that each replica only updates 
1
N
d
N 
d
​

​
  of the optimizer states. The keen reader must have noticed that there is no real need to have all gradients on all DP ranks in the first place as only a subset is needed for the optimization step. Meet ZeRO-2!

ZeRO-2: Adding Gradient Partitioning
Since we only need, on each replica, to have the gradient shard corresponding to the optimizer state shard, it makes sense to shard gradient as well similarly to the optimizer states. During the backward pass, instead of performing an all-reduce over the gradients, we only perform a reduce-scatter operation! Where we only spread the 
1
N
d
N 
d
​
 
1
​
  gradients needed in memory, thus saving more memory compared to ZeRO-1.

In case of FP32 gradient accumulation, we only need to keep

​

  fp32_grads where we accumulate the bf16 grads coming from the reduce-scatter. And in the optimizer step we use the

​
  fp32_grads.

It’s easy to see now that sharding the gradients leads to to

  is increased we can save up to 8x memory over the baseline. In terms of communication the same process applies as for ZeRO-1, with the only difference that we communicate and release on the fly. In total, ZeRO-2 is thus also equivalent to vanilla DP training w.r.t. communication.

In terms of communication ZeRO-2 is similar to ZeRO-1, they both require a reduce-scatter for the gradients, and an all-gather over all parameters.

Note: You might notice that there is no real overhead of using ZeRO-2 over ZeRO-1 and indeed ZeRO-2 is usually the best option.
Now that we’ve sharded gradients as well, are we done or can we keep getting away with this? Well, sort of. Here comes ZeRO-3!

ZeRO-3: Adding Parameter Partitioning
For Stage 3 we extend the above approach of sharding optimizer states and gradients over DP replicas up to sharding the model’s parameters.

📝 Note

This stage is also called FSDP (Fully Shared Data Parallelism) in PyTorch native implementation. We’ll just refer to ZeRO-3 in this blogpost but you can think of FSDP wherever you see it.

So how do we do a forward or backward pass in practice if all parts of the model are distributed? Quite simply we gather them on-demand when we need them. In the forward pass this looks as follows:

dp_zero3_fwd.svg

So as we perform the forward pass and sequentially go through the layers we retrieve the necessary parameters on demand and immediately flush them from memory when we don't need them anymore. The backward pass works the same way just inverted in flow and we produce the gradient shards:

dp_zero3_bwd.svg

The other issue is that we need to do these all-gathers continuously throughout the forward and backward step, which amounts to 
2
⋅
num_layers
−
1
2⋅num_layers−1 additional all-gathers in a training step compared to Zero-2, each comes with a small base latency overhead as we can see in the following figure:

dp_zero3_overlap.svg

During the forward pass we do all-gather operations for the parameters when we need them, so a 
Ψ
Ψ communication tax. Since we discard the parameters immediately after we needed them in the forward pass we need one more all-gather during the backward pass as well incurring another 
Ψ
Ψ in communication tax. Finally we need the same reduce-scatter as in ZeRO-2 for the gradients which costs also 
Ψ
Ψ in communication and we arrive at a total communication cost of 
3
Ψ
3Ψ, compared to 
2
Ψ
2Ψ for Zero-2.

This may sounds like a lot of communication overhead but it's actually pretty fine as we can overlap the communication of the parameters for the next layer with the forward pass of the current layer in what is called prefetching. With prefetching, we will "all-gather" weights for *Layer n+1* while we do the current forward for Layer n in the forward, and similarly, we will "all-gather" weights for Layer n-1 while doing the backward for Layer n. Of course this overlap only holds true as long as we don’t scale DP too much. (as a rule of thumb DP shouldn’t exceed 512)

In terms of memory we can see that our equation now reached it’s final form of

  which means we can drive memory usage down indefinitely if we can increase the DP rank, at least for the model related parameters. Notice how it doesn’t help with the intermediate activations, for that we can use activation checkpointing and gradient accumulation as we’ve seen in the previous chapters.

Let’s summarize our journey into DP and ZeRO so far: we have seen that we can increase throughput of training significantly with DP, simply scaling training by adding more model replicas. With ZeRO we can train even models that would ordinarily not fit into a single GPU by sharding the parameters, gradients and optimizers states across DP, while incurring a small communications cost.

If you want to read more about FSDP1, FSDP2 and some of the implementation complexities around them, you should take some time to go over this nice blog.
However, there is a limit here, DP only works if a layer of the model fits in a single GPU and ZeRO can only partition the parameters, gradients, and optimizer states, but not the activation memory! We recall from the activation memory discussion that this part of the memory scales with sequence length and batch size. Naturally we could just limit those, but in practice we don’t want to be limited by hardware to train with only with a short sequence length.

To overcome this issues, it's time to explore a new, orthogonal axis of parallelism - Tensor Parallelism (TP). Unlike ZeRO3 which relies on heavy parameter communication, TP proposes to shard parameters, gradients, optimizer states AND activations across devices without requiring any communication of model parameters between GPUs.

What? How is this even possible?! Let's explore this seemingly magical approach together! 🙂

Tensor Parallelism
To add a podcast feeling to your reading experience, feel free to listen to the NotebookLM hosts discussing the following sections of this book as you're reading along.

So we have sharded the model’s parameters, gradients and optimizers states with ZeRO but we hit a limit once activation memory overtakes our memory budget. Welcome Tensor Parallelism (TP), a method which shards weights, gradients, and optimizers states as well as activations and without the need to gather them all prior to the computation. Seems like a dream! Let’s first have a look at how Tensor Parallel works with simple matrix multiplications.

Tensor Parallelism leverages the mathematical properties of matrix multiplication

A×B. To understand how it works, let's examine two fundamental equations that make this parallelization possible:

This means that we can compute matrix product by either 1) multiplying each column of 
B
B individually or 2) multiplying each row individually and combining the results. In a neural network, the matrix multiplication is more often represented in the following format: 
X
×
W
X×W, where:

X represents the input or activation values
W represents the weight of the nn.Linear
In practice a small example of the operation looks like this:

TP diagram

Let’s see how we can parallelise this operation! In tensor parallelism, tensors will be split into N shards along a particular dimension and distributed across N GPUs. Matrices can be split either on the column part or row part leading to row and column parallelism. One thing we’ll see in the following is that choosing row or column sharding will require different communications primitives.

Our first option is to use column-wise sharding (also called column-linear): We'll copy the complete input matrices to each worker, requiring an operation called broadcast, and split the weight matrix into columns. The inputs are then multiplied with the partial weight matrices, and the results are finally combined using an all-gather operation.

image.png

Here's the code implementation of column wise tensor parallelism:

The second option is called row-wise sharding (also called row-linear): As the attentive reader might guess, row-linear means that we split the weight matrix into chunks of rows. However, this also requires us to split the inputs, which needs a scatter operation rather than a broadcast as used in column-linear sharding. The results on each worker are already in the right shape but need to be summed for the final result, thus requiring an all-reduce operation in this scenario.

We see here our fourth distributed primitive: scatter!

image.png

Here's the implementation for row-wise tensor parallelism:

Now that we have the basic building blocks of TP, let's have a look at how we can effectively combine them inside a transformer layer!

Tensor Parallelism in a Transformer Block
To come up with a strategy to follow, let’s move from a toy example to a real model building block. A Transformer model is made of two main building blocks : Feedforward layers (MLP) and Multi-Head Attention (MHA). We can apply tensor parallelism to both.

The Feedforward part can be parallelized by having a “Column linear” followed by a “Row Linear” which amounts to a broadcast to copy the input and an all-reduce in forward. Note that the broadcast isn’t needed in actual training where we can make sure inputs are already synced across TP ranks. This setup is more efficient than starting with "Row Linear" followed by "Column Linear" as we can skip the intermediate all-reduce between both splitted operations.

image.png

Now that we’ve found an efficient schema for the Feedforward part of the transformer, let’s take a look at the multi-head attention block (MHA).

We can generally follow a similar approach where Q, K, and V matrices are split in a column-parallel fashion, and the output projection is split along the row dimension. With multi-head attention, the column-parallel approach has a very natural interpretation: each worker computes the attention for an individual or a subset of heads. The same approach works as well for multi-query (MQA) or grouped query attention (GQA) where key and values are shared between queries.

It's worth noting however that the tensor parallelism degree should not exceed the number of Q/K/V heads because we need intact heads per TP rank (otherwise we cannot compute the attentions independently on each GPU and we'll need additional communication operations). In case we’re using GQA, the TP degree should actually be smaller than the number of K/V heads. For instance, LLaMA-3 8B has 8 Key/Value heads, so the tensor parallelism degree should advantageously not exceed 8. If we use TP=16 for this model, we will need to duplicate the K/V heads on each GPU and make sure they stay in sync.

image.png

Finally note that Tensor Parallelsim is still not a silver bullet for training. We’ve added several distributed communication primitive directly in the computation path of our model which are therefore hard to fully hide/overlap with computation (like we did in ZeRO), our final performances will be the results of a tradeoff between the computation and memory gains and the added communication overhead. Let's illustrate this:

Forward pass in Tensor Parallelism

It's possible to partially hide this communication by performing block matrix multiplication coupled with async communication/computation.
Looking at the timeline of operations in tensor-parallel MLP (same applies for Attention), we can better understand the tradeoffs involved. In the forward of each decoder layer, we hit a synchronization point with the AllReduce operation that cannot be overlapped with computation. This exposed communication overhead is necessary to combine partial results across tensor-parallel ranks before the final LayerNorm can be applied.

For example, Megatron-LM/Nanotron implement a partial overlapping of all-gather with FC1 computation where a portion of the matrix multiplication result will start to be sent to the other GPU while the other part is still being computed.
Tensor parallelism does help reduce activation memory for the matrix multiplications since the intermediate activations are sharded across GPUs. However, we still need to gather the full activations for operations like LayerNorm, which means we're not getting the full memory benefits we could. Additionally, TP introduces significant communication requirements that heavily depend on the network infrastructure. The inability to fully hide this particular AllReduce behind computation means it directly adds to the critical path of forward propagation.

This area of research is still an active area of research, with recent work like Domino 
[4]
 exploring novel techniques to maximize this overlap.
Let's take a better look at the trade-off as we scale the TP degree:

While increasing TP leads to reduced per-GPU throughput (left), it enables processing of larger batch sizes (right), illustrating the trade-off between computational efficiency and memory availability in distributed training.

In practice and as we see above on the left plot, the communication overhead of tensor parallelism becomes particularly noticeable as we scale beyond 8 GPUs. While tensor parallelism within a single node can leverage fast NVLink interconnects, going across nodes requires slower network connections. We observe significant drops when moving from TP=8 to TP=16, and an even steeper decline from TP=16 to TP=32. At higher degrees of parallelism, the communication overhead becomes so high that it quickly dominates the computation time.

This being said, tensor parallelism provides important benefits for memory usage by distributing model parameters, gradients, optimizer states and activations (to some extent) across GPUs. Let's examine this effect on a 70B parameter model:

Increasing tensor parallelism reduces the memory needed for model parameters, gradients and optimizer states on each GPU to the point where we can start fitting a large model on a single node of 8 GPUs.

Is there a way to get even more benefits from this technique? We've seen that layer normalization and dropout still require gathering the full activations on each GPU, partially negating the memory savings. We can do better by finding ways to parallelize these remaining operations as well.

📝 Note

One interesting note about layer normalization in tensor parallel training - since each TP rank sees the same activations after the all-gather, the layer norm weights don't actually need an all-reduce to sync their gradients after the backward pass. They naturally stay in sync across ranks. However, for dropout operations, we must make sure to sync the random seed across TP ranks to maintain deterministic behavior.

Let's explore next a small and natural extension to tensor parallelism, called Sequence Parallelism which does exactly that.

Sequence Parallelism
Sequence parallelism (SP) involves splitting the activations and computations for the parts of the model not handled by tensor parallelism (TP) such as Dropout and LayerNorm, but along the input sequence dimension rather than across hidden dimension.

📝 Note

The term Sequence Parallelism is a bit overloaded: the Sequence Parallelism in this section is tightly coupled to Tensor Parallelism and applies to dropout and layer norm operation. However, when we will move to longer sequences the attention computation will become a bottleneck, which calls for techniques such as Ring-Attention, which are sometimes also called Sequence Parallelism but we’ll refer to them as Context Parallelism to differentiate the two approaches. So each time you see sequence parallelism, remember that it is used together with tensor parallelism (in contrast to context parallelism, which can be used independently).

This is needed because these operations require access to the full hidden dimension to compute correctly. For example, LayerNorm needs the full hidden dimension to compute mean and variance:

LayerNorm
(
x
)
=
γ
⋅
x
−
μ
σ

ϵ

LayerNorm(x)=γ⋅

where

)
μ=mean(x) and 
σ
2
=
var
(
x
)
σ 
2
 =var(x) are computed across hidden dimension 
h
h.

So even though these operations are computationally cheap, they still require significant activation memory since they need the complete hidden dimension. SP allows us to shard this memory burden across GPUs by splitting along the sequence dimension instead.

In practice we’ll go from the left diagram to the right:

 in forward: f = no-op ; f* = all-reduce ; g = all-gather ; g* = reduce-scatter
            in backward: f = all-reduce ; f* = no-op ; g = reduce-scatter ; g* = all-gather
           SP region needs full hidden_dim

The diagram shows how we transition between tensor-parallel and sequence-parallel regions using different collective operations (labeled "f" and "g"). The key challenge is managing these transitions efficiently while keeping memory usage low and maintaining correctness.

In the forward pass:

"f" is a no-op (no operation) because activations are already duplicated across ranks
"f*" is an all-reduce to synchronize activations and ensure correctness
In the backward pass:

"f*" is a no-op because gradients are already duplicated across ranks
"f" is an all-reduce to synchronize gradients
These operations "f" and "f*" are called conjugate pairs because they complement each other - when one is a no-op in forward, the other is an all-reduce in backward, and vice versa.

For sequence parallelism (SP), we use different operations labeled "g" and "g*". Specifically, we avoid using all-reduce in the SP region since that would require gathering the full activations and increase our peak memory usage, defeating the purpose of SP.

So what is actually happening here? As a famous LLM would say, let’s take it step-by-step:

Initial LayerNorm (SP Region)

Input tensors X1 and X2 (b,s/2,h) enter LayerNorm, already split across sequence dimension
Each GPU computes LayerNorm independently on its sequence chunk and give Y1 and Y2
First Transition (SP → TP)

"g" operation (all-gather) combines Y1 and Y2 back to full sequence length
Restores Y (b,s,h) since column linear needs full hidden dimension h
First Linear (TP Region)

A1 is a column-linear, so it splits Y along the hidden dimension
GeLU is applied independently on each GPU
Z1* is (b,s,h/2)
Second Linear (TP Region)

B1 is a row-linear, so it restores the hidden dimension
W1 is (b,s,h)
Final Transition (TP → SP)

"g*" operation (reduce-scatter) which reduces for previous row-linear correctness while scattering along sequence dimension
W1* is (b,s/2,h)
image.png
A key advantage of sequence parallelism is that it reduces the maximum activation size we need to store. In tensor parallelism alone, we had to store activations of shape (b,s,h) at various points. However, with sequence parallelism, the maximum activation size is reduced to 
b
⋅
s
⋅
h
t
p
tp
b⋅s⋅h
​
  since we always either split along the sequence or hidden dimensions.

It’s a bit difficult to keep track of all the parts that are sharded differently in TP and TP/SP - believe us, we find it hard to map as well so we made this small table to summarize how the activations (aka hidden_states ) shape change across hidden dimension h and sequence dimension s during a forward pass:

Region	TP only	TP with SP
Enter TP (Column Linear)	h: sharded (weight_out is sharded)
s: full	h: sharded (weight_out is sharded)
s: all-gather to full
TP Region	h: sharded
s: full	h: sharded
s: full
Exit TP (Row Linear)	h: full (weight_out is full + all-reduce for correctness)
s: full	h: full (weight_out is full + reduce-scatter for correctness)
s: reduce-scatter to sharded
SP Region	h: full
s: full	h: full
s: sharded
And for the embedding layer:

Region	Vanilla TP	TP with SP
Embedding Layer (Row Linear sharded on vocab)	h: full (weight_out is full + all-reduce for correctness)
s: full	h: full (weight_out is full + reduce-scatter for correctness)
s: reduce-scatter to sharded
By using sequence parallelism, we can achieve even greater activation memory savings, allowing us to push our batch size and sequence length further than what would be possible with tensor parallelism alone. Let's see what that means for our previous 70B model example:

As we can see, we've again strongly reduced the maximum memory usage per GPU, allowing us to fit sequence lengths of 16k tokens with TP/SP=16, an improvement over the vanilla TP case! (TP=16 is still a bit large as we've seen in the previous section, but we'll see how we can improve this in the next section).

One question you may be asking yourself is whether using TP+SP incurs more communication than vanilla TP? Well, yes and no. In the forward pass of a vanilla TP we had two all-reduce per transformer block, and in SP we have two all-gather and two reduce-scatter per transformer block. So SP does twice the number of communication operations as TP. But since an all-reduce operation can be broken down into to an all-gather + reduce-scatter (see the A quick focus on Ring AllReduce section in the appendix) they’re actually equivalent in terms of communication. Same reasoning for backward as we just use the conjugate of each operation (no-op ↔ allreduce and allgather ↔ reducescatter).

If you’ve been paying close attention, you’ll notice that we’re talking about 4 comms ops in each layer (2 for Attention and 2 for MLP). This is how the MLP profiling looks like when using Tensor + Sequence Parallelism:

tp_sp_overlap.svg

Just like vanilla TP, TP+SP can’t easily be overlapped with compute, which makes throughput heavily dependent on the communication bandwidth. Here again, like vanilla TO, TP+SP is usually done only within a node (keeping the TP degree under the number of GPU per nodes, e.g. TP≤8).

We can benchmark how this communication overhead becomes increasingly problematic as we scale up tensor parallelism. Let’s measure the throughput and memory utilization as we scale TP with SP for a 3B model with 4096 seqlen:

Here again, there's a trade-off between computational efficiency (left) and memory capacity (right). While higher parallelism degrees enable processing of significantly larger batch sizes by reducing the activation memory, they also reduce per-GPU throughput, in particular above a threshold corresponding to the number of GPUs per node.

Let’s summarize our observations:

for both methods we notice the biggest performance drop when we move from TP=8 to TP=16, because that’s when we move from only communicating within a single node (NVLink), to communicating inter-nodes (EFA)
the memory savings in activations when using TP with SP helps us fit far bigger batches than TP alone
the memory savings in activations when using TP with SP helps us fit far bigger batches than TP alone
We have seen how TP helps us shard activations across several GPUs by splitting the attention and feedforward operations along the hidden dimension and how SP is a natural complement for the remaining operations by splitting along the sequence dimension.

📝 Note

Since LayerNorms in the SP region operate on different portions of the sequence, their gradients will differ across TP ranks. To ensure the weights stay synchronized, we need to all-reduce their gradients during the backward pass, similar to how DP ensures weights stay in sync. This is however a small communication overhead since LayerNorm has relatively few parameters.

However, there are two limits to TP and SP: 1) if we scale the sequence length the activation memory will still blow up in the TP region and 2) if the model is too big to fit with TP=8 then we will see a massive slow-down due to the inter-node connectivity.

We can tackle problem 1) with Context parallelism and problem 2) with Pipeline parallelism. Let’s first have a look at Context parallelism!



## 05

Context Parallelism
With Tensor Parallelism and Sequence Parallelism, we can reduce the memory requirements per GPU significantly as both model weights and activations are distributed across GPUs. However, when training models on longer and longer sequences (e.g. when scaling to 128k or more tokens per sequence) we might still exceed the memory available on a single node as we still have to process a full sequence length when we're inside the TP region.

Moreover, even if we use full recomputation of the activations (which comes at a heavy compute overhead of ~30%), we still need to hold in memory some activations at the layer boundaries which scale linearly with sequence length. Let's take a look and see how Context Parallelism can help us:

The core idea of Context Parrallelism is to apply a similar idea to the Sequence Parallelism approach (aka to split along the sequence length) but to the modules where we already apply Tensor Parallelism. We will thus split these modules along two dimensions, thereby also reducing the effect of sequence length. You will find this approach quite intuitive after all we’ve already convered but... there is a trick to it so stay awake!

For Context Parallelism; just like Sequence Parallelism, we’ll split the input along the sequence dimension but we now apply this splitting along the full model, instead of only the sequence parallel regions of the model as we’ve done previous with Tensor + Sequence Parallelism.

Splitting the sequence doesn't affect most modules like MLP and LayerNorm, where each token is processed independently. It also doesn’t require expensive communication like TP, as only the inputs are split and not the weight matrices. Just like data parallelism, after computing the gradients, an all-reduce operation is initiated to synchronize the gradients across the context parallelism group.

There is one important exception though as we we need to pay particular attention to the Attention blocks (haha.. pun intended :D). In the attention module each token needs to access key/value pairs from all other sequence tokens or in the case of causal attention at least attends to each previous token.

Because Context Parallelism splits the inputs along the sequence dimension across GPUs, the attention module will requires full communication between GPUs to exchange the necessary key/value data.

That sounds very expensive if we do it naively. Is there a way to do this rather efficiently and fast! Thankfully there is: a core technique to handle this communication of key/value pairs efficiently is called Ring Attention.

📝 Note

Context Parallelism shares some conceptual similarities with Flash Attention (see later for more details) - both techniques rely on online softmax computation to reduce memory usage. While Flash Attention focuses on optimizing the attention computation itself on a single GPU, Context Parallelism achieves memory reduction by distributing the sequence across multiple GPUs.

Discovering Ring Attention
In this implementation of the attention mechanism, each GPU first initiates an asynchronous communication operation to send its key/value pairs to other GPUs. While waiting for the other GPUs data, it computes the attention score for the portion of the data it already has in memory. Ideally, a next key/value pair is received from another GPU before this computation finishes, allowing the GPU to start the next round of computation immediately after it finishes its first computation.

Let's illustrate this. We'll suppose we have 4 GPUs and an input of 4 tokens. Initially, the input sequence is split evenly along the sequence dimension, so each GPU will have just one token along with its corresponding Q/K/V values. Leyt's say Q1, K1, and V1 represent the query, key, and value of the first token, which are located on the 1st GPU. The attention calculation will take 4 time steps to complete. At each time step, each GPU performs these three successive operations:

Send “current keys and values” to the next machine except during the last time step in a non-blocking manner so we can starts the following step before this step is finished
Locally compute the attention score on the “current keys and values” it already has, which typically involves performing 
S
o
f
t
m
a
x
(
Q
K
T
d
)
∗
V
Softmax( 
d
​
 
QK 
T
 
​
 )∗V.
Wait to receive keys and values from the previous GPU and then circle back to step 1. where “current keys and values” are now the key/values just received from the previous GPU.
We perform these 3 steps four times to complete the attention calculation.

The whole process with 4 GPUs is shown in the following animation:

ring-attention.gif

It's probably obvious to you on this animation why the authors chose to call this approach Ring Attention.

There is one big problem though which is that a naive implementation of Ring Attention lead to some strong imbalance between GPU coming from the shape of the causal attention matrix. Let’s take a look at the SoftMax computation by considering the attention score matrix with the causal attention mask:

cp_attnmask.svg

The SoftMax is computed row-wise, which means whenever a GPU has received all the tokens of a row it can be computed. We see that GPU1 can immediately compute it as it starts with tokens 1-4 and GPU1 actually doesn’t need to receive any information from any other GPUs. However, GPU2 will need to wait for the second round to also receive 1-4 and thus have all values for tokens 1-8. Also, GPU1 seems to perform much less work than all the other GPUs.

Let’s see if we can balance our computations better:

Zig-Zag Ring Attention – A Balanced Compute Implementation
We need a better way to distribute the input sequences. This can be achieved by assigning the tokens not purely sequential to the GPUs but by mixing the ordering a bit such that we have a good mix of early and late tokens on each GPU. This approach is called Zig-Zag attention
[5]
 and in this new arrangement, the attention mask will show an even distribution of computation but if you count the number of colored squares, you’ll see that the computation is now balanced across all GPUs.

cp_zigzagmask.svg

At the same time we’ll also see that in order to complete all rows, each GPU will need information from all the other GPUs.

We have two general ways to overlap computation and communication, either by performing a general all-gather, regrouping all the KV on each GPUs at the same time (in a Zero-3 type of way) or we gather them one-by-one from each GPU to each GPU as needed:

cp_overlap_allgather.svg

cp_overlap_all2all.svg

The key difference between these two implementations lies in their communication patterns and memory usage:

1. AllGather Implementation:

All GPUs simultaneously gather the complete key/value pairs from all other GPUs
Requires more temporary memory as each GPU needs to store the full KV pairs at once
Communication happens in one step but with larger memory overhead
2. All-to-All (Ring) Implementation:

GPUs exchange KV pairs in a ring-like pattern, one chunk at a time
More memory efficient as each GPU only needs to store one additional chunk temporarily
Communication is spread out and overlapped with computation, though with some additional base latency overhead from multiple communication steps
The All-to-All approach generally offers better memory efficiency at the cost of slightly more complex communication patterns, while the AllGather approach is simpler but requires more temporary memory during the attention computation.

We've now seen how we can split a model across one node with TP to tame large models and that we can use CP to tame the activation explosion with long sequences.

However, we still know that TP doesn't scale well across nodes, so what can we do if the model weights don't easily fit on 1 node? Here come another degree of parallelism, our forth one, called Pipeline Parallelism, to the rescue!

Pipeline Parallelism
To add a podcast feeling to your reading experience, feel free to listen to the NotebookLM hosts discussing the following sections of this book as you're reading along.

In the Tensor Parallelism section we saw that trying to scale Tensor parallelism past the number of GPUs per single node (typically 4 or 8) hit a lower bandwidth network called “inter-node connection” which can quite strongly impair our performances. We can see this clearly on e.g. the all-reduce operation when we benchmark it on our cluster across several nodes (each node has 8 GPUs):

Inter-node communication bandwidth measurements across different node counts, showing median (lines) and 5th-95th percentile ranges (shaded areas) for AllReduce, AllGather and ReduceScatter operations.

Sequence and context parallelism can help for long sequences but don’t help much if the sequence length is not the root cause of our memory issues but rather the size of the model itself. For large model (70B+), the size of the weights alone can already push past the limits of the 4-8 GPUs on a single node. We can solve this issue by summoning the fourth (and last) parallelism dimension: “pipeline parallelism”.

Pipeline parallelism is a simple but powerful technique - we split our model's layers across multiple GPUs! For example, if we have 8 GPUs, we could put layers 1-4 on GPU 1, layers 5-8 on GPU 2, and so on. This way, each GPU only needs to store and process a portion of the model's layers, significantly reducing the memory requirements per GPU. Let's see the effect of Pipeline Parallelism in action on the memory usage for a 8B model:

This technique may remind you of our discussion on ZeRO-3 where we split the model parameters across GPUs. We compare both techniques in details later in the 5D parallelism in a nutshell section.
Looking at the figure above, we notice something interesting: while the model parameters are nicely split across GPUs, the activation memory remains the same on each GPU! This is because each GPU still needs to process the full batch of data, just with different layers. The activations from one GPU's layers will be sent to the next GPU to continue the forward pass.

This introduces a new type of communication pattern: instead of communicating parameters like we did with ZeRO-3 in data parallelism, we're now passing activation tensors sequentially between GPUs in a "pipeline". While conceptually simple, efficiently implementing this technique is quite tricky. Let's dive right into the details!

Splitting layers on various nodes - All forward, all backward
So, let’s say we simply spread the layers on several devices, e.g. a first GPU will take the first few layers and a second GPU will take the second part of the models and so on. The forward pass through our model now simply involves sequentially passing the batch of data along the model and thus successively using each compute device.

We have a direct first advantage: the required interconnect bandwidth stays quite low as we only send moderate-sized activations at a handful of location along the model depth. It can make a huge difference versus e.g. communications in Tensor Parallelism, which happens several times within each layer.

But maybe you start feeling a glimpse of the troubles to come: “sequentially” and “successively”?!? This doesn’t sound very efficient in the world of parallel computations, especially after our discussion on computation and communication overlap.

Indeed reader! The main challenge in pipeline parallelism will be how to efficiently circumvent the sequential nature of PP to keep our GPU busy at all times and avoid having one GPU computing while the others are waiting. Here is how our GPU utilization is looking when doing a naive and simple forward and backward pass through the model (here the numbers indicate the model layers):

An example of Pipeline parallelism for a model with 16 layers distributed across 4 GPUs. The numbers correspond to the layer IDs.

The remaining idle time is indicated in grey and usually called the “bubble” and the sight of this probably break your heart after we spent so much time optimizing throughput.

We can quantify how efficient a pipeline setup is by looking at how much time we loose because of the bubble. Let’s say 
t
f
t 
f
​
  and 
t
b
t

​
 ≈2×t

​
  which you can see on the above graph). If we could perfectly parallelize the ideal total time would be

p is the degree of pipeline parallelism, i.e the number of GPU on the above graph) ie. the time each GPU is waiting while other GPUs are computing.

We can compute the ratio of the additional bubble time over the ideal time:

​
 =p−1
As we add more stages the bubble time thus increases and the utilization drops. As we can see, the bubble can be very large in a naive implementation!

Thankfully, various pipeline parallelism schemes have been designed to reduce the size of the bubble.

Let’s take a first tool out of our toolbox and think about splitting our batch into smaller bit-sized portions which can be processed in parallel or almost, like we did before in data parallel for instance. Now when the second GPU is busy processing micro-batch 1, the first GPU can already start processing micro-batch 2. Here is a schedule using 8 micro-batches:

pp_afab2.svg

Before the numbers in the diagram indicated the layers but in all pipeline parallel plots from now including this one it indicates a microbatch. You can think of each square here to contain several layers as seen in the previous figure.
The above schedule is called the all-forward-all-backward (AFAB) schedule as we first do all forward passes and then only all-backward passes. The advantage is that forward and backward steps are still generally sequential and so we're preserving the general organization of our model training code. It makes this PP implementation one of the simplest to implement.

You can find the full implementation of the AFAB pipeline in picotron:

Let’s estimate the bubble in this example. The difference with our first example is that the ideal time to process

As we can see, we can fight some inefficiencies of pipeline stages by adding more microbatches, reducing the size of the bubble by a factor of 
m
m.

However, as annoying as the bubble is the memory storage required for storing all activation. We need to keep all of the activations in memory until we reach the backward stage which lead to a quick memory explosion in these implementations of PP. Can we do better and avoid this memory explosion?

Since the memory explosion is triggered by the activation we store for the backward pass, let’s try to see if we can start performing the backward pass while we are still performing other forward part of the computation. This will allow us to drop some of the activations we need for the backward pass as soon as possible.

One-forward-one-backward and LLama 3.1 schemes
This schedule is called one-forward-one-backward (1F1B) as the middle/steady state involves alternatively performing one forward and one backward pass. The general idea is to start performing the backward pass as soon as possible. The schedule looks like this:

image.png

If you count carefully you'll see that the bubble still has the same size so our training efficiency is not significantly improved. However we only need to store activations for 
p
p micro-batches (where 
p
p is the degree of pipeline parallelism) instead of 
m
m (where 
m
m was the number of microbatches) which can reduce the activation memory explosion we had in the AFAB schedule. As a consequence we can add more microbatches which then will actually reduce the bubble.

A major complexity of this setup, visible on the above graph is how forward and backward passes are not anymore cleanly sequential but performed in parallel across devices and interleaved. This means we will have to schedule a switch from forward to backward passes independently on each device instead of in a simple and common central training loop as usual.

This is one of the reason implementing Pipeline Parallelism usually requires rather extensive modifications to training code as well as modeling code.

You can find a full implementation of 1F1B in picotron as well:

Let's take a look at how the 1F1B Pipeline Parallelism schedule scales in practice with some benchmarks on our cluster:

Throughput scaling of Pipeline Parallelism with varying microbatch sizes

On the left, with a number of microbatches equal to –or less than– PP degree minus one (
m
=
p
−
1
m=p−1), we see how detrimental the pipeline bubble can be - performance are low and even drops as we scale PP. The right plot shows that using many more microbatches than PP degree (
m
=
3
2
≫
p
−
1
m=32≫p−1) helps improve low-PP-degree performances while still staying limited at very large PP degree. In practice it's not possible to arbitrarly increase the number of microbatches to maintain the ratio of 
m
≫
p
−
1
m≫p−1 since we're ultimately constrained by the target global batch size. With a maximal possible number of microbatches as we add more PP degree, we'll ultimately have to increase the bubble size according to 
r
b
u
b

l
e

​

​
 .

Interestingly, at small number of micro-batches the performance only drops by 14% when scaling from one node (
p
=
8
p=8) to two nodes (
p
=
1
6
p=16) - a much better scaling than Tensor Parallelism which typically sees around 43% performance degradation in similar cross-node scenarios. This type of behavior when hitting the lower-bandwith inter-node network makes Pipeline Parallelism particularly attractive for distributed training across multiple nodes.

While 1F1B significantly reduces our activation memory footprint, we see on this last graph that the pipeline bubble remains a major efficiency bottleneck. With the bubble size still proportional to the number of pipeline stages, we're leaving valuable GPU compute idle. Can we design an even smarter schedule to minimize this wasted computation time?

Interleaving stages
The 1F1B schedule has let us improved memory usage but not much the size of the idle buddle. Any way we could still push this frontier?

Well it turns out this is possible if we are willing to bring in a few additional communication operations. Time to talk about interleaved stages.

Up to now we’ve sliced our model naively along the model depth dimensions, hosting for instance layers 1-4 on the first GPU and layers 5-8 on the second GPU. But there are other ways we could think about slicing our layers, e.g. having odd layers 1, 3, 5, 7 on the first GPU and even layers 2, 4, 6, 8 on the second GPU.

This can be seen in general as a kind of “looping pipeline” where a micro-batch will move in circles from one GPU to the next as it goes through the forward pass through the model. Let's take a graphical look at how this works:

pp_1f1b_interleaved.svg

An example of interleaved pipeline parallelism for a model with layers distributed across 4 GPUs. Numbers still correspond to the microbatches IDs but for clarity we've colored differently the first and the last layers of the model to illustrate how layers are spread accross GPUs.

As a consequence we see additional communications happening as the model goes several times through each GPU for the same computation that previously just took one pass. However, each forward and backward pass is divided by a factor of 
v
v, where 
v
v is the number of stages or model chunks per GPUs as we are able to better interleave forward and backward passes.

​
 
So we can now decrease the bubble by adding microbatches and interleaved stages, but note that quantitatively, the amount of communication also increases by 
v
v so it’s a trade off. In the following plot you can see several configurations for a PP setup with 
p

p=8, where the special case of 
m

v

m=1,v=1 corresponds to naive pipeline parallelism and the configurations with 
v
=
1
v=1 are AFAB or 1F1B setups and 
v

1
v≠1 are interleaved configurations.

Scheduling also becomes more complex here as we have to decide on a given GPU and at a given moment whether we are prioritizing earlier micro-batches going through later layers –meaning that we close the forward and backward loops as fast as possible (so called “depth-first”, i.e. prioritizing getting batches out of the model as fast as possible)– or if we prioritize to first have later micro-batches going through earlier layers (so called “breadth-first” i.e. prioritizing filling in the pipeline as much as possible). This choice is explained in detail in the nice "Breadth-Fist Pipeline" paper
[6]
.

You now have all the elements to understand the pipeline parallelism approach in Llama 3.1 which is using a one-forward-one-backward setup with interleaved stages and a priority setting tuneable between depth-first and breadth-first.

pp_llama3.1_schedule.png

However, we haven’t reached the end of possible pipeline schedules and recently some methods have been proposed to reduce the bubble to virtually zero! These techniques were for instance used in the DeepSeek V3/R1 implementation
[7]
. Peaked your curiosity? Let’s have a final quick look at these magical schedules before we leave the world of Pipeline Parallelism!

Zero Bubble and DualPipe
Even more sophisticated ways to reduce the bubble have recently been proposed which reached close to a “zero bubble” regime. The secret here is to split at an even finer-grained level the operations involved in order to interleave them in the most efficient way. For instance the pipeline implementation approach in DeepSeek V3/R1, called DualPipe, reaches close to a zero bubble regime.

Ultimate "flex" in DeepSeek V3 technical report
[7]
 where the authors indicate that their setup "achiev[ed] a near-zero all-to-all communication overhead".
Let’s briefly see how this can work by summarizing the ZeroBubble
[8]
 work which is a precursor to DualPipe. The base observation of ZeroBubble is that the backward pass through a matrix multiplication actually involves two separated operations: backward operation for the inputs (B) and the backward operation for the weights (W):

While the output of B, the backward pass for the input, is necessary for performing the backward pass of the lower layers, the backward pass of the weights, W, is not necessary for the rest of the backward pass and generally only needs to be performed before the optimiser step. We can see that in the following diagram:

image.png

This means W can be flexibly scheduled anywhere after the corresponding B of the same stage. This allows for strategic placement of W to fill the pipeline bubbles. The ZB-H2 schedule on the top right is an example of (theoretical) schedule with zero bubble taking advantage for this fine-grained decomposition.

image.png

On the top (Figure 2 from the ZeroBubble paper): the classical 1F1B schedule, interleaving forward and backward pass but keeping a coarse-grained backward pass. On the bottom two graphs (Figure 3 from the ZeroBubble paper), two variantes of the ZeroBubble schedule, splitting the backward operation in a "B" and a "W" finer-grained operations. The last schedule, so-called "ZB-H2" is an example of (theoretical) schedule with zero bubble taking advantage for this fine-grained decomposition.

DeepSeek’s DualPipe introduced with its V3 technical report 
[7]
 an extension of this decomposed approach to the additional case of two streams propagating from both ends of the PP dimension, these streams being interleaved to minimize even further idle time in the GPUs. This schedule is displayed in the following scheduling graph and is even more complex than the previous ones:

image.png

In general, fully optimizing such complex schedules involve carfully measuring the duration of the various fine-grained operations and solving a ILP to minimize the final bubble time. See for instance in the ZeroBubble paper
[8]
 for a discussion of the heuristics and algorithms to perform such a scheduling. As a result, the ZeroBubble and DualPipe schedules are too complex for us to give here code snippets but you should start to have a general idea of the concepts involved.

This concludes our tour into the world of pipeline schedules and bubbles. We hope you enjoyed this guided tour!

It's now time to turn to the last parallelism method we'll detail and which we can use to train large models efficiently: Expert parallelism.

## 07

Expert parallelism
This is our last parallelism method to discuss. Before tackling it, if you don't have any exposure to Mixture-of-Experts, feel free to read about them in this previous, much shorter, blog post we published some time ago and which should help you better understand the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in general.

Mixture-of-expert models have gained recent traction and visibility with models such as GPT-4, Mixtral
[9]
 or more recently DeepSeek-V3/R1. The basic idea is that instead of having a single feedforward module per layer we can have several parallel modules and route tokens through one or the other to be processed differently.

ep_moe.png

Illustrationg of a MoE layer taken from the Switch Transformers paper
[10]

The design of MoE layers makes it actually easy to implement parallelism across the experts dimension for what we will call Expert parallelism (EP). Since the feedforward layers are fully independent we can simply put each expert's feedforward layer on a different worker. Compared to TP it's much more lightweight, since we don't need to split the matrix multiplication, we just need to route the hidden states of a token to the right expert.

In practice, EP will typically be used in conjunction with other forms of parallelism - for instance Data Parallelism. This is because EP only affects the MoE layers and doesn't shard the input tokens (unlike Context Parallelism which shards tokens along the sequence length dimension). This means our GPUs would be doing redundant compute for all the non-MoE blocks if we only used EP. By combining EP with DP, we can efficiently shard both the experts and the input batches across our GPUs, as we can see in the simplified diagram below:

ep_schema.png

Source: A Survey on Mixture of Experts
[11]

But let's not get ahead of ourselves - our following section will specifically talk about all the interactions between different parallelism strategies, so don't worry if you don't understand yet this last diagram.

In practice, there are a few tricks to make EP work efficiently and they are closely tied to model design. For instance, DeepSeek-V3 enforces a constraint in the router, ensuring that each token is sent to at most M nodes (in their case, 4) to keep the tokens on a single node and reduce communication overhead. While Expert parallelism has been around for a while
[12]
 it is just now gaining new traction with the MoE architecture gaining more traction.

We plan to add a more complete example of EP in picotron/nanotron soon, so stay tuned for more!

5D parallelism in a nutshell
Congratulation reader, you have now seen all 5 parallelism strategies you can use to scale model training:

Data Parallelism (DP) – along the batch dimension
Tensor Parallelism (TP) - along the hidden dimension
Sequence and Context Parallelism (SP/CP) - along the sequence dimension
Pipeline Parallelism (PP) - along the model layers
Expert Parallelism (EP) - along the model experts
As well as the 3 ZeRO strategies which can be combined with Data Parallelism for memory reduction:

ZeRO-1 – sharding optimizer states among the DP replicas
ZeRO-2 – sharding optimizer states and gradients among the DP replicas
ZeRO-3 – sharding optimizer states, gradients and parameters among the DP replicas
At this stage, one aspect you are probably curious about is how all these parallelism and ZeRO strategies compare to, and interact with, each other. In other words, which ones should we use and efficiently combine together, and which ones should we rather keep separated?

Let’s take a look at the similarities and interplay. We'll start by comparing Pipeline parallelism are ZeRO-3 side-by-side as they have some very close similarities but also important differences.

Pipeline parallelism vs. ZeRO-3 - Both PP and ZeRO-3 are ways to partition the model weights over several GPUs and perform communication/computation along the model depth axis (for example in ZeRO-3, we prefetch the next layer while computing). This means in both cases full layer operations are computed on each device, as opposed to TP or EP for instance in which computation are performed on sub-layer units.

In the following we say “a layer” to simplify what should be in general called “a set of layer” (as the basis sharding unit of the model).
However, there are a few major differences between PP and ZeRO-3 approaches:

ZeRO-3	Pipeline Parallelism
Each compute unit stores	only a fraction of a layer	a full layer
Communication is used to transfer	weights	activations
Orchestration	model agnostic	model agnostic
Implementation challenges	Complex to handle model partitioning and communications	Complex to handle efficient PP schedules
Scaling considerations	Prefers large 
m
b
s
mbs and 
s
e
q
_
l
e
n
seq_len to hide comms	Prefers large 
grad_acc
grad_acc to hide bubble
As you can see, ZeRO-3 and PP sove the same challenge but involve different approaches and the choice between both will depend whether you decide to focus communication either on weights or on activations. While they can be combined, it's not often done in practice as doing so requires increasing the global batch size significantly to amortize the communication costs, creating a tradeoff between global batch size, model size, network bandwidth, and training efficiency. If you decide to combine them, ZeRO-3 should be configured to keep the weights in memory during the series of PP micro-batches to minimize as much as possible un-necessary communication overhead.

On the other hand, ZeRO-1 and ZeRO-2, which focus on optimizer states and gradients, can be easily combined with Pipeline Parallelism and are complementary to it. Combining them don't raise any particular new challenge. For instance, the training of DeepSeek-v3 used PP combined with ZeRO-1 (sic).

Tensor Parallelism (with Sequence Parallelism) is naturally complementary and can be combined with both Pipeline Parallelism and ZeRO-3 as it relies on the distributive property of matrix multiplications which allows weights and activations to be sharded and computed independently before being combined.

TP & SP diagram
The main reason we don't want to use TP only for parallelism is that, in practice, TP has two limitations we've discussed in the previous sections: First, since its communication operations are part of the critical path of computation, it's difficult to scale well beyond a certain point at which communication overhead begins to dominate. Second, unlike ZeRO and PP which are model-agnostic, TP requires careful handling of activation sharding - sometimes along the hidden dimension (in the TP region) and sometimes along the sequence dimension (in the SP region) - making it more cumbersome to implement correctly and requiring model-specific knowledge to ensure proper sharding patterns throughout.

As a consequence, when combining parallelism strategies, TP will typically be kept for high-speed intra-node communications while ZeRO-3 or PP can be used for parallelism groups spanning lower speed inter-node communications as their communication patterns require less bandwidth (for PP) or can be more easily overlapped with computation (for ZeRO-3). The main consideration when combining these techniques is to organize the GPU efficiently in groups for each parallelism dimension to maximize throughput and minimize communication overhead, while being mindful of TP's scaling limitations. For instance, the groups of GPUs communicating for TP should be kept inside nodes.

Context Parallelism and Expert Parallelism also help us shard activations, and can be seen as complimentary to TP. The first one handles long sequences while the second enables distributed Mixture of Experts training and they can be combined together without any particular issue.

Context Parallelism (CP) specifically targets the challenge of training with very long sequences by sharding activations along the sequence dimension across GPUs. While most operations like MLPs and LayerNorm can process these sharded sequences independently, attention layers require communication since each token needs access to keys/values from the full sequence. As we saw in CP section, this is handled efficiently through ring attention patterns that overlap computation and communication. CP is particularly valuable when scaling to extreme sequence lengths (128k+ tokens) where, even when using full activation recomputation, the memory requirements for attention would be prohibitive on a single GPU.

CP diagram
Expert Parallelism (EP) specifically targets the challenge of training Mixture of Experts (MoE) models by sharding specialized "experts" across GPUs and dynamically routing tokens to relevant experts during computation. The key communication operation in EP is the `all-to-all` operations routing tokens to their assigned experts and gathering the results back. While this operation introduces some communication overhead, it enables scaling model capacity significantly since each token is only processed during inference (and training) by a much smaller fraction of the total parameters. In terms of distributed training/inference, partitioning experts across GPUs becomes relevant when models scales to a large number of experts.

For instance DeepSeek V3 uses 256 experts.
EP diagram
📝 Note

This similarity between EP and DP in terms of input handling is why some implementations consider Expert Parallelism to be a subgroup of Data Parallelism, with the key difference being that EP uses specialized expert routing rather than having all GPUs process inputs through identical model copies.

Scope and focus Let's also quickly summarize the sub-part of the model where some of these different parallelism strategies have the most impact:

Tensor Parallelism (and Sequence Parallelism) affects computation throughout the entire model by sharding both weights and activations.
Context Parallelism primarily impacts attention layers since that's where cross-sequence communication is required, with other layers operating independently on sharded sequences.
Expert Parallelism primarly affects the MoE layers (which replace standard MLP blocks), leaving attention and other components unchanged
Pipeline Parallelism and ZeRO are not especially specific to any sub-module or component with the exception that modules and layers need to be balanced in Pipaline Parallelism, the first and last layers are thus often treated differently due to the additional embedding layers.
Tensor + Sequence Parallel	Context Parallel	Expert Parallel
shards weights and activations along hidden/seq dim	shards activations along sequence dim	shards specialized expert weights and activations
communication for matrix multiply operations (column/row linears)	communication for attention key/values	communication for token routing to experts
model-specific implementation needed	model-agnostic except for attention	model-agnostic except for MoE layers
Prefers high-bandwidth intra-node communication	Prefers large sequence lengths	Requires MoEs
Summarizing it all– Now what about gathering and combining all the techniques we've seen in a single diagram combining them all. Yes, we're up for the challenge!

In this summary diagram, you will find illustrated activations and modules for a single transformers layer –in it's MoE variant–. We also illustrate the various directions of parallelism and the communication operations we've been discussing in all the previous sections.

image.png

We can also represent side-by-side a full overview of the memory savings for each one of these strategies. We'll plot them with different sequence length as well as with selective (top) and full (bottom) recomputation so you can see how they all play with activations:

5Dparallelism_8Bmemoryusage.svg
Let's finish this section with a high level view at all of these techniques, their main underlying idea and major bottleneck:

Method	Memory savings applies specifically on	Parallel/sharding dimension	Disadvantage
DP	Activations (reduce local batch size)	Batch	Limited by max batch size
PP	Model parameters	Model layers	Idle bubble and complex schedules
TP/SP	Model parameters and activations	Hidden dimension / Sequence length	Requires high bandwidth communication
CP	Activations	Sequence length	Add communication overhead in attention modules
EP	Experts parameters	Expert dimension	Requires MoE layers, add routing communication overhead
ZeRO-1	Optimizer states	Sharded among DP replicas	Params communication overhead
ZeRO-2	Optimizer states and gradients	Sharded among DP replicas	Params communication overhead
ZeRO-3	Optimizer states, gradients, and model parameters	Sharded among DP replicas	Params communication overhead
Clearly, none of these techniques is a silver bullet for magical scaling and we'll often have to combine them in one way or another. Can we actually come up with a few rules that would help us find a good starting point to choose among –and combine– them? This will be the topic of our next section.

Finding the Best Training Configuration
We’ve now covered all the parallelism techniques that are actually used to distribute and training larger models as well as how and why they can be combined together. There remain a general question: which ones should we choose in the end and how to decide on a specific combination?

We touched this a little bit in the previous section but let's now walk in details through a possible decision process, step by step, keeping in mind that you'll always have to run a few experiments to find the definitive optimal setup for your compute cluster given its various physical properties, network bandwidth, GPUs per node, memory per GPU, etc.

Step 1: Fitting a Training Step in Memory
First, we need to figure out how we can fit a full model instance on our GPUs. There are two general cases.

GPU-rich case 🤑 - when you have plenty of GPUs available:

For models under 10B parameters, you can use a single parallelism technique, e.g. Tensor Parallelism or ZeRO-3/DP with Full Recompute across 8 GPUs
For models between 10B-100B parameters requiring more than 8 GPUs, you have several options:
Combining Tensor Parallelism (TP=8) with Pipeline Parallelism
Combining Tensor Parallelism (TP=8) with Data Parallelism (ZeRO-3)
Using only ZeRO-3 (i.e. only pure Data Parallelism)
At 512+ GPU scale, pure Data Parallelism/ZeRO-3 will start to becomes inefficient due to communication cost - it can be better to then combine DP with either Tensor or Pipeline Parallelism
At 1024+ GPU scale, a recommended setup can be Tensor Parallelism TP=8 with Data Parallelism (ZeRO-2) and Pipeline Parallelism
We focus on fitting a single instance for now - even though we may use DP for ZeRO to achieve this goal - we're only interested here in the model-parameters memory savings that it provide when used with ZeRO-3.
Special considerations:

For very long sequences, you will probably want to add Context Parallelism (CP) across nodes.
For Mixture of Experts architectures, you will advantageously use Expert Parallelism (EP) across nodes.
GPU-poor case 😭 - when you might be low on GPU resources:

You can enable full activation recomputation to trade some compute for memory (and train a bit slower).
You can increase gradient accumulation to process larger batches with limited memory.
Now that we have a first model instance training, we need to make sure we have the right batch size.

Step 2: Achieving Target Global Batch Size
Depending on where step 1 left us in terms of micro batch size and DP, our current batch size might be too small or too big. It's now time to hit our target batch size.

To increase our current global batch size:

We can scale up Data Parallelism or gradient accumulation steps
For long sequences, we can leverage Context Parallelism
To decrease our current global batch size:

We can reduce Data Parallelism in favor of other parallelization strategies
For long sequences, we can reduce Context Parallelism
Ok, now we have the model running in the general configuration we want in terms of model size and batch size, but are we training it the fastest way? Let's now start to optimize throughput as much as possible.

Step 3: Optimizing Training Throughput
So we want to make sure the training is running as fast as possible so all our precious GPUs are well utilized at all times. As long as memory and communication aren't bottlenecks we can try the following:

Benchmarking thousands of configurations
Now that we've covered the step-by-step, let's implement this search process in real-life.

You will find, in the nanotron repository, several scripts you can use to run all the experiments we discussed above and be able to benchmark your own model and cluster in real life.

We actually ran ourself benchmarks on several thousands of distributed configurations covering every model size we've discussed above as well as a very large number of cluster configurations (namely 1-64 nodes of 8xH100s) we could try in order to produce the results we've covered up to now in this book.

We want to take this opportunity to apologize to our co-workers for blocking most of the science cluster and in turn forgive any threats that may have been whispered.
Now let's take a step back to gather and analyze the results of all our benchmarks and see if, beyond theory, we can actually discover on real-world data how various configurations fare against each other.

All the following benchmarks were conducted with a sequence length of 4096 and a global batch size of 1M tokens. We gathered all the top configurations for each model and cluster size and plotted them in the following heatmaps:

image.png

Heatmap visualization showing the optimal training configurations across different model sizes and compute node counts (we have 8 GPUs per node). For each combination, the configuration details include Data Parallelism (DP), Tensor Parallelism (TP), Pipeline Parallelism (PP), Gradient Accumulation Steps (GAS), Micro Batch Size (MBS), and ZeRO optimization stage. The color intensity indicates the Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU), with brighter colors representing higher efficiency.

From this high-level visualization, we can draw several important insights:

First, as we increase the number of nodes (higher parallelism), we observe a decrease in efficiency. This effect is particularly pronounced for smaller models, which have a lower compute-to-model-size ratio. While we might typically compensate for small model size by increasing the batch size, we're constrained by our global batch size limit of 1M.

Second, Larger models present a different challenge. As model size increases, memory requirements grow substantially. This creates two scenarios with fewer nodes: either the model doesn't fit at all, or it barely fits but runs inefficiently due to operating near the GPU memory limits (see for instance the 80B parameter model training on 4 nodes).

Finally, our benchmarks show how performance heavily depends on implementation quality. When we first implemented both parallelism strategies, Tensor Parallelism (TP) outperformed Pipeline Parallelism (PP). After optimizing our PP code, it became the faster option. Now that we're improving the communication overlap in our TP implementation, we expect it to regain the performance lead.

Lessons learned on benchmarking
Our goal for this book was not only to discuss theory and implementations but provide actual data points as well. So the plan was simple: lets run every possible distributed configuration for every model and a number of cluster sizes (namely 1-64 nodes of 8xH100s). Even after excluding impossible configuration we still needed to run thousands of experiments.

On paper this sounds easy enough: we can easily launch big arrays of jobs on our cluster. However, as soon as we launched the first batches of experiments, troubles began:

PyTorch processes would sometimes fail to clean up properly
Slurm job manager would forcefully terminate jobs, leading to node failures
Simple benchmarks that should take minutes would stretch into hours
Some jobs would hang indefinitely
Running all experiments in a finite amount of time required additional engineering and we ended up spending a significant amount of time on things like:

Minimizing cluster restart times and optimize idle time
Analyzing detailed NCCL debug logs
Understand memory usage patterns and CUDA memory allocator behaviors
Improving pipeline parallelism performance on multi-node
These challenges deserve their own story, but they taught us valuable lessons about the complexities of distributed training infrastructure. What looks simple in theory often requires careful attention to many moving parts in practice.

Reproducing theoretical results in practice is challenging, especially given the limited availability of production training code. Through open-source projects like nanotron and picotron, we hope we can help making distributed training techniques more accessible as well as collaborating on simple and efficient codebases that help researchers and practitioners take the most out of their hardware resources.

This concludes our very deep dive into the distribution methods of 5D parallelism.

Taking a step back, our discussion so far has often relied on a critical assumption - that computation and communication can be efficiently overlapped on GPUs without any impact on the computation throughput. The reality is more nuanced. When using common communication primitives like NCCL send/recv, we face hidden contention between computation and communication resources as communication kernels will usually make use of the same GPU streaming multiprocessors (SMs) that are used for computation, leading to decreased throughput when communication is overlapped with computation. To truly optimize our distributed training, we need to dive deeper into the GPU architecture itself.

Additionally, the synchronization patterns when overlapping computation and communication may not always be optimal for our parallel strategies. You can find an example for instance in this blog post by the Pytorch team.
Time to turn the lights off and activate CUDA mode!

Diving in the GPUs – fusing, threading, mixing
To add a podcast feeling to your reading experience, feel free to listen to the NotebookLM hosts discussing the following sections of this book as you're reading along.

Up to now our discussion has been focused on the high-level organization of our model operations. We’ve moved around computations on various accelerators, taking into account general memory constraints and high-level scheduling of the compute units.

But this ignored all the optimizations we can do at a much lower level by carefully understanding how our model operations are scheduled and performed on each GPU.

This section will dive into much more details of the GPU architecture and in particular in NVIDIA’s GPU architecture but the general ideas, as often, can be reused on similar accelerator units.

We’ll briefly explain how GPU are organized before covering the Flash-Attention revolution, how to efficiently schedule workload on GPU and finally explain how various precisions can be efficiently used on GPU.

A primer on GPU
Generally, GPUs have a very hierarchical organization. In this primer we’ll keep the discussion at the concept levels that are necessary for the rest of our presentation.

On the compute side, GPUs consist of an array of compute units called Streaming Multiprocessors (SM). Each SM contains and controls a set of streaming processors, also known as cores. For example, an Nvidia H100 GPU has 132 SMs with 128 cores per SM, resulting in a total of 16,896 cores (see docs for tensor cores for details), each capable of handling multiple threads simultaneously.

The memory side is also highly hierarchical with several layers of cache and memory: Registers are the smallest units and are private to the threads during executions, Shared Memory and L1 cache are shared between the threads running on a single SM, higher up is the L2 cache shared by all SMs, finally there is the Global Memory which is the largest memory on the GPU (the advertised 80 GB for a H100 for instance) but also the slowest to access and query.

The goal of GPU will be to run as many workloads as possible, in parallel, on the GPU cores, by taking advantage of this hierarchical organization of compute/memory.

A piece of code running on a core of the GPU is called a kernel. It can be written at a high-level in CUDA or Triton for instance, and is then compiled to Parallel Thread Execution, PTX, the low-level assembly used by NVIDIA GPUs.

To run the kernel, you will also need a specific code part, called host code, which is executed on the CPU/host and will take care of preparing data allocations and loading data and code.

// Host code                
void vecAdd(float* h_A, float *h_B, float *h_c, int n) {
    // Allocate vectors in device memory
    int size = n * sizeof(float);
    float *d_A, *d_B, *d_C;
    cudaMalloc(&d_A, size);
    cudaMalloc(&d_B, size);
    cudaMalloc(&d_C, size);

    // Copy vectors from host memory to device memory
    cudaMemcpy(d_A, h_A, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_B, h_B, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    // Invoke kernel
    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid =
            (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
    VecAdd<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_A, d_B, d_C, N);

    // Copy result from device memory to host memory
    // h_C contains the result in host memory
    cudaMemcpy(h_C, d_C, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    // Free device memory
    cudaFree(d_A);
    cudaFree(d_B);
    cudaFree(d_C);
}

Kernels are generally scheduled as follow:

threads are grouped in warps of sizes of 32. All the threads in a warp are synchronized to execute instructions simultaneously but on different parts of the data.
warps are grouped in larger blocks of more flexible size (e.g. size 256), each block still being assigned to a single SM. An SM may run several blocks in parallel, however, depending on the resources, not all the blocks may get assigned for execution immediately, some can be waitlisted waiting for resources.
The main thing to remember from these details is that there are various sizing and allocation constraints (size of the various memories, number of concurrent block and threads in the wraps) which need to be taken into account to use the GPU architecture in the most efficient way.

Most of the time you don’t need to go down to this level of precision and you can luckily reuse the kernels and code prepared by other members of the community. But in any case we want to give you a primer on how to get started with kernels!

How to improve performance with Kernels ?
If you’re looking to add a new operation that lacks an optimized kernel or to speed up an existing PyTorch function, writing kernels from scratch might seem like the most direct route. However, creating high-performance CUDA kernels from scratch requires extensive experience and a steep learning curve. Generally a better way to get started is to leverage torch.compile, which dynamically optimizes PyTorch code by capturing your operations and generating lower-level, high-performance kernels in triton.

Let’s suppose you want to write a kernel for an activation function called Exponential Linear Unit:

ELU
(
x
)
=
{
e
x
−
1
if 
x
<
0
x
if 
x
≥
0
ELU(x)={ 
e 
x
 −1
x
​
  
if x<0
if x≥0
​
 
You can start by a simple pytorch implementation and then just add the @torch.compile decorator on top:

@torch.compile
def elu(x, alpha=1.0):
    return torch.where(x < 0, alpha * (torch.exp(x) - 1), x)
The distinction between the compiled and non-compiled versions is striking, especially given that we only added a single decorator. This remarkable difference is illustrated in the graph below (N is the number of columns):

image.png

However, if this performance increase is insufficient, you can consider implementing Triton kernels. As a starting point, you can take a look at the triton kernel generated by @torch.compile . To do so, you simply need to set the environment variable TORCH_LOGS to "output_code":

export TORCH_LOGS="output_code"
Once you run the Python script with the @torch.compile decorator, it will generate and output the corresponding Triton kernel, which, in this case, is:

@triton.jit
def triton_(in_ptr0, out_ptr0, xnumel, XBLOCK : tl.constexpr):
    xnumel = 100000000
    xoffset = tl.program_id(0) * XBLOCK
    xindex = xoffset + tl.arange(0, XBLOCK)[:]
    xmask = xindex < xnumel
    x0 = xindex
    tmp0 = tl.load(in_ptr0 + (x0), xmask)
    tmp1 = 0.0
    tmp2 = tmp0 < tmp1
    tmp3 = tl_math.exp(tmp0)
    tmp4 = 1.0
    tmp5 = tmp3 - tmp4
    tmp6 = tl.where(tmp2, tmp5, tmp0)
    tl.store(out_ptr0 + (x0), tmp6, xmask)
To enhance readability, we can modify the variable names, add comments, and make slight adjustments (or ask an LLM to do it for us), as demonstrated below:

@triton.jit
def elu_kernel(input_ptr, output_ptr, num_elements, BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr):
    # Calculate the starting index for this block
    block_start = tl.program_id(0) * BLOCK_SIZE
    # Create an array of indices for this block
    block_indices = block_start + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)[:]
    # Create a mask to ensure only valid indices are processed
    valid_mask = block_indices < num_elements
    # Load input values from the input pointer based on valid indices
    input_values = tl.load(input_ptr + block_indices, valid_mask)
    # Define the ELU parameters
    zero_value = 0.0  # Threshold for ELU activation
    negative_mask = input_values < zero_value
    exp_values = tl.math.exp(input_values)
    # Define the ELU output shift
    one_value = 1.0
    shifted_exp_values = exp_values - one_value

    output_values = tl.where(negative_mask, shifted_exp_values, input_values)

    # Store the computed output values back to the output pointer
    tl.store(output_ptr + block_indices, output_values, valid_mask)
Here, tl.program_id(0) provides a unique block ID, that we use to determine which section of data that block will process. Using this block ID, block_start calculates the starting index for each block’s section, while block_indices specifies the range of indices within that section. A valid_mask ensures that only indices within num_elements are processed, safely loading the data with tl.load. The ELU function is then applied, modifying values based on whether they're negative, and results are written back to memory with tl.store.

When we benchmark the generated kernel using triton.testing.Benchmark we have the following performance:

image.png

This standalone kernel even demonstrates superior performance with smaller sizes compared to @torch.compile but this is likely just an artifact of the compilation time of torch.compile. In any case, instead of starting from scratch, remember that you can start from such generated kernels and focus your attention to optimizing its performance, saving you a lot of time in the process.

Even in Triton, sometimes, we cannot fully achieve the peak performance of the device due to the language limitations to handle low level details like shared memory and scheduling within streaming multiprocessors (SMs). Triton capabilities are restricted to blocks and scheduling of blocks across SMs. To gain an even deeper control, you will need to implement kernels directly in CUDA, where you will have access to all the underlying low-level details.

Moving down to CUDA, various techniques can be employed to improve the efficiency of kernels. We will just cover a few here: optimizing memory access patterns to reduce latency, using shared memory to store frequently accessed data, and managing thread workloads to minimize idle times.

Before we dive deeper in CUDA examples, let's summarize the tools we've seen that let us write kernel code to execute instructions on the GPU:

Pytorch: easy but slow
torch.compile: easy, fast, but not flexible
triton: harder, faster, and more flexible
CUDA: hardest, fastest, and flexiblest (if you get it right)
Let’s talk about one of the most frequent technique we can use in CUDA: optimizing memory access. The global memory in GPUs (the largest memory in our above graph) has a long latency and low bandwidth in comparison to the cache which often creates a major bottleneck for most applications. Efficiently accessing data from global memory can improve a lot the performance.

Memory Coalescing
To effectively utilize the bandwidth of global memory, it is essential to understand its architecture. In CUDA devices, global memory is implemented using DRAM.

Memory coalescing takes advantage of how DRAM delivers data in bursts, or ranges of consecutive memory locations, whenever a memory address is accessed. Each time a DRAM location is accessed, a sequence of consecutive locations, including the requested one, is read in parallel by multiple sensors in the DRAM chip. Once read, this data can then be quickly transferred to the processor as a burst. In CUDA, coalescing uses this burst behavior to maximize memory access efficiency by ensuring that threads in a warp—32 threads that execute the same instruction in lockstep (SIMD)—access consecutive memory locations. For instance, if thread 0 accesses location M, thread 1 accesses M + 1, thread 2 accesses M + 2, and so forth, the GPU hardware coalesces or combines these requests into one large, efficient access request for the DRAM burst, rather than handling each access individually.

Let’s take the example of matrix multiplication. A simple, straightforward implementation would have each thread compute a single element of the output matrix, like this:

__global__ void matmul_naive(int M, int N, int K, const float *A, const float *B, float *C) {
    const uint x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    const uint y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;

    if (x < M && y < N) {
        float tmp = 0.0;
        for (int i = 0; i < K; ++i) {
            tmp += A[x * K + i] * B[i * N + y];
        }
        C[x * N + y] = tmp;
    }
}
Here’s an excellent visualization of the kernel from this fantastic blogpost:

image.png

However, when profiling this kernel with a tool like ncu, we can see issues, including low memory throughput and uncoalesced memory accesses.

image.png image.png
The reason for this is that in this kernel, two threads in the same block with Thread IDs (0, 0) and (1, 0) (which will end up in the same warp) will both load from the same column of matrix B but different rows of matrix A. Since matrix elements are stored in row-major order (meaning row elements are in consecutive memory addresses, as shown in the figure below) thread (0, 0) will load 
A
0
,
0
A 
0,0
​
 , and thread (1, 0) will load 
A
1
,
0
A 
1,0
​
  in the first iteration i = 0. These elements are not stored close to each other in memory, and this misalignment will be present at each iteration, thereby preventing memory accesses from being coalesced.

image.png

To improve the performances of our kernel we can change the way coordinates x and y are calculated to the following:

const int x = blockIdx.x * BLOCKSIZE + (threadIdx.x / BLOCKSIZE);
const int y = blockIdx.y * BLOCKSIZE + (threadIdx.x % BLOCKSIZE);

if (x < M && y < N) {
float tmp = 0.0;
for (int i = 0; i < K; ++i) {
    tmp += A[x * K + i] * B[i * N + y];
}
C[x * N + y] = tmp;
}
Instead of using a 2D block, we switch to a 1D block and redefine how we determine the values of x and y. In this new method, threads within the same warp (which have close threadIdx.x values) will share the same x value but have different y values. This means that they will load the same row of matrix A but different columns of matrix B. As a result, memory accesses can be coalesced for a row-major matrix.

When we profile our new kernel, we notice that the warning about uncoalesced memory accesses has disappeared, and the GPU's memory throughput has increased by approximately 10 times.

image.png

We also notice that the execution time of the kernel decreases by 10x! Amazing.

Now let's cover another technique you will often see mentioned in the litterature: tiling.

Tiling
Tiling is a technique that leverages shared memory to optimize memory access patterns. As we mentioned above, the shared memory is a small, fast memory accessible by all threads within a block. It allows data to be reused by multiple threads, reducing the need to repeatedly load data from slower global memory.

In matrix multiplication for example, each thread in a block may need elements from two matrices, say A and B. If each thread independently loads the row and column it needs from global memory, we end up with many redundant loads, as multiple threads in a block will access overlapping data. Instead, we can use tiling to load a block (or tile) of A and B into shared memory just once, allowing all threads in that block to reuse the same shared data.

In the tiling approach, each iteration involves all threads within a block to cooperatively load two tiles—one from matrix A and another from matrix B —into shared memory. Specifically, threads load a tile of matrix A (of size BLOCK_SIZE_M by BLOCK_SIZE_K) and a tile of matrix B (of size BLOCK_SIZE_K by BLOCK_SIZE_N). Once the tiles are in shared memory, the threads perform matrix multiplication on these tiles, enabling efficient computation since all necessary data is quickly accessible. The results of the tile multiplication are stored in an accumulation matrix that holds intermediate results. After each iteration, the results from the current tile multiplication are added to this accumulation matrix, continuing until all tiles from both matrices have been processed.

image.png

From https://cnugteren.github.io/tutorial/pages/page4.html

Let's take a look at the important parts you need to understand from the implementation:

// Set pointers to the starting elements
A += blockRow * TILE_SIZE * K; // Start at row = blockRow, column = 0
B += blockCol * TILE_SIZE; // Start at row = 0, column = blockCol
C += blockRow * TILE_SIZE * N + blockCol * TILE_SIZE; // Start at row = blockRow, column = blockCol
float sum = 0.0;
// The outer loop moves through tiles of A (across columns) and B (down rows)
for (int tileIdx = 0; tileIdx < K; tileIdx += TILE_SIZE) {
sharedA[localRow * TILE_SIZE + localCol] = A[localRow * K + localCol];
sharedB[localRow * TILE_SIZE + localCol] = B[localRow * N + localCol];

// Ensure all threads in the block have completed data loading
__syncthreads();

// Shift pointers to the next tile
A += TILE_SIZE;
B += TILE_SIZE * N;

// Compute the partial dot product for this tile
for (int i = 0; i < TILE_SIZE; ++i) {
    sum += sharedA[localRow * TILE_SIZE + i] * sharedB[i * TILE_SIZE + localCol];
}
// Synchronize again to prevent any thread from loading new data
// into shared memory before others have completed their calculations
__syncthreads();
}
C[localRow * N + localCol] = sum;
For simplicity we consider a square shaped tile.
Each thread begins by loading one element from both Matrix A and Matrix B into shared memory. In this scenario, achieving coalesced memory access is straightforward, by assigning threadIdx.x as the local column index (localCol), threads within the same warp will access adjacent elements of both matrices. After each thread in the block completes loading its elements into shared memory (ensured by calling __syncthreads()), they proceed to compute the dot product of the two tiles. Once the threads have iterated through all the tiles—horizontally for Matrix A and vertically for Matrix B—the resulting sum is stored in the corresponding location of Matrix C.

When benchmarking this kernel using ncu, we noticed that the memory throughput increased to 410 Gb / s, and the kernel execution time decreased by ~43% achieving a ~6.6 TFLOPs performance

Thread Coarsening
The tiling technique has significantly improved the performance of our kernel. However, when analyzing the warp states which quantify how many cycles were spent in each state, we observe the following:

image.png

The meaning of these cryptic state names can be found in NVidia's profiling Guide, in the Warp Stall Reasons section. There we can read that:

"smsp__pcsamp_warps_issue_stalled_mio_throttle: Warp was stalled waiting for the MIO (memory input/output) instruction queue to be not full. This stall reason is high in cases of extreme utilization of the MIO pipelines, which include special math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure."

So it seems warps are stalling waiting for shared memory accesses to return! To solve this issue we can apply a technique called Thread Coarsening which involves merging several threads into a single coarsened thread. This will significantly reduce shared memory accesses as each coarsened thread can handle multiple output elements.

Let's briefly mentionned a last important consideration when writing or improving custom kernels: Minimizing Control Divergence.

Minimizing Control Divergence
A Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) is built to execute all threads in a warp using the Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) model. This means that at any given moment, one instruction is fetched and executed simultaneously for all threads within the warp. When a warp is executed, the threads within it operate on different segments of the data but follow the same instruction, hence the name Single Instruction, Multiple Data. The primary advantage of SIMD is its efficiency; the control hardware responsible for instruction fetching and dispatching is shared among multiple execution units. This design minimizes the hardware overhead associated with control functions, allowing a greater portion of the hardware to focus on improving arithmetic throughput.

Control divergence occurs when threads within the same warp take different execution paths. For instance, if a conditional statement (like an if statement) leads to some threads executing one block of code while others execute a different block, the warp must serialize these executions, resulting in idle threads waiting for others to complete. To minimize control divergence, we need to design kernels to ensure that threads within the same warp follow the same execution path. This can be achieved by restructuring code to reduce branching, using data structures that ensure all threads follow similar execution paths, or employing techniques such as predication.

We have covered some of the main considerations when writing custom kernels and improving the performance and memory footprint of GPU operations. But there’s one more important concept before moving to a real example which is “fusing kernels”.

Fused Kernels
In several places now we’ve mentioned how GPU and CPU operation can be asynchronous. In particular, the host code on the CPU can schedule workload on the GPU in a non-blocking way.

Non-blocking can be useful for overlapping communication and computation –as we saw many times along our journey– but can be extended to the more general idea of trying to avoid at all cost going back and forth between host and GPU kernel commands.

This idea is beautifully illustrated by Horace He in these diagrams:

image.png
A sequence of kernels requiring back and forth between global memory and compute units

image.png
Instead of sending our triangle back to global memory just to read it back again, we instead just do all of our operations in one go.

How can we avoid this back and forth? Well the best way is to make our GPU as autonomous as possible. This is achieved by packing as many successive compute operations together in a single kernel for the GPU to run, called a “Fused Kernel”.

Fused kernel are especially efficient and simple to write for succession of point-like operations which are performed independently of each other on each input tokens. In this case, there is no point in bringing back computed values in Global Memory before moving them to SM memory and spinning up a new kernel. It’s much more efficient to keep all values locally until the succession of computation has been performed.

There are many places in a Transformer model where this "fusing" approach can be applied: every time we have a succession of point-wise operations e.g. in the computation involved in the Layer norms.

We now have all the understanding necessary to marvel at a true masterpiece of kernel engineering: Flash Attention

Flash Attention 1-3
Flash attention was introduced by Tri Dao and proposed to optimize the attention computations by writing custom CUDA kernels make them much faster *and* more memory efficient. The idea behind Flash Attention is to make efficient use of the various memories of the GPU to avoid relying too much on the slowest one: the global memory of the GPU.

Note that the global memory of the GPU is confusingly called the "High Bandwidth Memory", HBM 🫠
A basic implementation of the attention mechanism involve a lot of transfer between memory and workers. It requires materializing the S and P matrices in HBM which means that the results need to be sent to HBM and then back to SRAM for the next computations:

image.png

Since bandwidth is much lower in HBM this introduces a severe bottleneck in the attention computation. Can we do better? Tri Dao says yes!

The key element is to compute the S matrices in small pieces which can fit in the smaller shared memory of the SM. But we can do even better and avoid materializing the very large S matrix all together in favor of keeping only the necessary statistics for computing the normalization factor of the softmax. So we can compute part of 
O
O directly in one computation in SRAM rather than moving intermediate results back and forth. In this case, not even do we make use of the shared memory but we also release the memory bottleneck resulting from materializing one of the largest activation matrices in the model (at long context length), the attention matrix.

Source: FlashAttention paper
[13]

The idea of flash attention resolves so many bottlenecks in model training that it has quickly become the default way to perform attention in all transformers:

By avoiding to materialize the S matrix we reduce the memory burden of attention
We also remove a large part of the naive impact of the S^2 cost of attention
As a result as well, all variants of linear attention and sub-quadratic approaches to approximate attention –developed shortly after the invention of the transformers architecture– have been mostly put aside in favor of this exact and fast flash attention implementation and mechanism.

Following Flash-attention 1, two successive improved versions have been released by the same lab: Flash-attention 2 and 3. In comparison to Flash-attention 1, the improvements in Flash-attention 2 and 3 are less about the general attention mechanism than about tailoring its low level implementation more specifically to the GPU by (1) reducing the number of non-matmul operations as much as possible (2) partitioning carefully the workload among wraps and thread blocks (for Flash Attention 2) and carefully optimizing for FP8 and Tensor Core support on the latest Hopper (H100) architecture for Flash Attention 3.

Flash attention puts some restrictions on which attention patterns can be sped up. Check out FlexAttention which is a fast and flexible variant.
Flash-Attention is a master demonstration of the breakthrough improvements that can come when you take into account the internal memory/compute design of current GPU accelerators.

The techniques described so far in this operation-fusion section have required us to implement modeling code changes and write custom kernels for certain operations in order to speed up training.

In the final section of our low-level dive in the compute operations themselves, we will take a look at a range of methods that are agnostic to the modeling code and can be used for any model and are so widely used that they have become a standard in the industry: Mixed Precision Training!

Mixed Precision Training
In various sections along this book, we've talked about lower precisions formats and their impact on the memory requirements for storing activations, parameters and optimizer states. It's now time to dive deeper in the details of these formats and understand better their trade-offs, advantages and limitations.

Mixed Precision Training, as the name suggests, involves mixing different precisions when training. The default numerical precision of PyTorch tensors is single-precision floating point format or also called FP32 or float32 which means that every number stored takes up 32 bits or 4 bytes. The available bits to represent a number are divided into 3 parts:

Sign: the first bit determines if the number is positive or negative
Mantissa: determines the significant figures of a number
Exponent: controls the magnitude of the number
sign-mantissa-exponent.svg

The principle of floating point numbers can be easily illustrated by recalling the scientific notation of numbers, e.g. 
−
5
.
7
3
4
×
1
0
7
−5.734×10 
7
 , where we first have the sign, followed by the mantissa an the exponent. As such we can represent numbers across a wide range of magnitudes with an adaptive precision. Although float32 is the default there is a range of floating point formats available in PyTorch:

Format	Total bits	Sign	Exponent	Mantissa
float32	32	1	8	23
float16	16	1	5	10
bfloat16	16	1	8	7
float8 (e4m3)	8	1	4	3
float8 (e5m2)	8	1	5	2
Note: You might be wondering where the “b” in bfloat16 comes from. The format was developed at Google Brain and thus the “b” stands for “brain”.
Reducing the total number of bits comes at a price (no free lunch here either), but we have some control over how to pay. Either we can sacrifice more bits on the mantissa or exponent. For this reason there exist also two float8 formats, named according to exponent and mantissa, to flexibly choose the most appropriate format. We can look at the possible range of numbers for each format:

image.png

We can see that float32 spans 80 orders of magnitude and float16 sacrifices a lot of range while bfloat16 maintains the full range. The two float8 formats reduce the range even further where e5e2 can maintain float16 range and e4m3 has an even smaller ranger.

How come some format are able to maintain the range and other not? Let’s investigate the resolution by plotting 10,000 points between 1 and 2. Each point will be rounded to the nearest representable number in each format:

image.png

We can see here that bfloat16 maintained the range of float32 over float16 but did this with the cost of sacrificing more precision. In case of float8 the situation is even more dire as e4m3 can represent 7 and e5m2 only 3 number on the interval 1-2.

A common metric to measure a formats resolution is epsilon: the first representable number after 
1
.

1.00. We can see that for the float32 format 
1

−4
  is an upper bound (it’s actually 
1

−7
 ). For float16 it is 
1
~
0
−

~

  and for bfloat 10x higher still.

The idea of mixed precision training is to use some of these lower precisions formats while maintaining the performance of full precision training.

It turns out we can’t totally abandon float32 and usually will need to maintain some parts in full precision. This is why lower precision training is usually called mixed precision training.

Let’s now take a look at training models with 16 bits and then see if we can take it a step further all the way down to 8 bits.

FP16 and BF16 training
Naively switching all the tensors and operations to float16 unfortunately doesn’t work and the result is usually diverging losses. However, the original mixed precision training paper
[2]
 came up with three tricks to match float32 trainings:

FP32 copy of weights: There are two possible issues with float16 weights. During training some of the weights can become very small and will be rounded to 0. However, even if the weights themselves are not close to zero, if the updates are very small the difference in magnitude can cause the weights to underflow during the addition. Once the weights are zero they will remain 0 for the rest of training as there is no gradient signal coming through anymore.
Loss scaling: We have a similar issue with the gradients as well as gradients tend to be much smaller than 1 and are thus at risk to underflow. A simple, yet effective, strategy is to scale the loss before the backward pass and unscale the gradients after the backward pass. This ensures that there is no underflow during the backward pass and the scaling is not affecting training as we unscale before processing the gradients further (e.g. clipping) and the optimization step.
Accumulation: Finally, when performing certain arithmetic operations in 16-bit precision such as averages or summations, we can also face under or overflows. A solution is then to accumulate intermediate results in float32 during the operation and only cast the final result back to 16 bit precision.
With these techniques, we can get a stable training while benefitting from a higher throughput due to the faster, lower precision arithmetic operations. Naturally, as a curious reader –and by now slightly addicted to maximizing the throughput– you may ask the question: can we go further and faster than 16-bit precision?

Maybe!

FP8 pretraining
Even if we perfectly overlap communication with computation, we always eventually run into the low level theoretical FLOPS limit of the hardware itself, i.e. the efficiency of each individual operation on our hardware. This is where numerical precision becomes crucial. For instance, on NVIDIA's H100 GPU, FP8 matrix multiplications (GEMM operations) achieve twice the theoretical FLOPS of bfloat16, making lower-precision training an attractive path for further optimization.

Recent research - including FP8-LM
[14]
, torchao
[15]
, and DeepSeek-V3
[7]
 - has demonstrated the potential of FP8 training for large-scale models. Still, FP8 pretraining introduces a significant challenge: stability. At lower precision, numerical instability often leads to loss divergence, making it difficult to match the accuracy of higher-precision training.

We know that instability increases as learning rates rise for a fixed model size
[16]
, making FP8 pretraining particularly tricky.

Here is an example of a typically divergent loss curve for FP8 training:


The first, successful, very large scale training with FP8 mixed precision was publicly reported on DeepSeek-V3. The authors carefully analyzed each operation of the forward pass (Fprop) as well as the activation (Dgrad) and weight (Wgrad) backward pass. Similar to BF16 mixed precision training, some aggregation and master weights are kept in higher precision while the operations themselves are performed in FP8.

image.png

In order to switch from high precision (e.g. FP32 or BF16) to lower precision (e.g. FP16 or FP8) with smaller range, we need to normalize the range of activation values, for instance by computing their absolute maximum. DeepSeek-V3 further introduced a specific quantization scheme where the ranges are normalized per tile: 1x128 for inputs/activations and 128x128 for weights and scale elements. This makes the normalization less strongly impacted by outlier values in the activations. There is a number of additional tricks they proposed to further reduce the memory and communication footprint which you can follow in section 3.3. of the DeepSeek-V3 technical report
[7]
.

Here’s a summary of a few known approaches to FP8 training:

GEMM's precision	Master model weights	Accumulated gradients	Model weights	Gradients	Optimizer States	Total Memory
bfloat16 with fp32 mixed precision baseline	bf16	fp32	fp32	bf16	bf16	fp32 + fp32	4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 = 20 bytes
Above without FP32 grad accumulation	bf16	fp32	n/a	bf16	bf16	fp32 + fp32	4 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 = 16 bytes
Transformer Engine	fp8	n/a	n/a	fp32	fp32	fp32 + fp32	4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 bytes (20% reduction)
FP8-LM's O3 level	fp8	fp16	fp16	fp8	fp8	fp8 + fp16	2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 9 bytes (55%)
DeepSeek-V3	fp8	fp32	fp32	fp8	bf16	bf16 + bf16	4+4+1+2+2+2 = 15 (25%)
nanotron's FP8	fp8	bf16	fp32	fp8	fp8	fp8 + fp8	2 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10 bytes (50%)
Overall, FP8 remains –in early 2025– an experimental technique and methods are still evolving. Given its obvious benefits, it will likely become the standard and soon replace bf16 mixed-precision. To follow an open-source implementations of FP8 training techniques, please head to the nanotron’s implementation in this PR.

Projecting further into the future, Blackwell, the next generation of NVIDIA chips, have been announced to support FP4 training, further speeding up training but without a doubt also introducing a new training stability challenge.

This last section concluded our long journey in the land of fast and large model training on tens to thousands of GPUs. Time to slowly bring our GPU cluster to rest and take a step back to conclude on all we've learned along the way.

Conclusion
Congratulations, dear reader, you made it to the end! We've completed quite a journey: we started from understanding how to train a simple model on a single GPU, all the way to mastering all the intricate techniques used to efficiently train massive language models like Llama-405B and DeepSeek-V3 on thousands of GPUs. By now, you can read a diagram, like Llama-3's 4D parallel setup, with (relative) ease:

image.png

Orchestrating large clusters of GPUs to train LLMs efficiently is no easy feat. We learned how to optimize computations and communications between GPUs such that they run with maximum utilization at all times. It involves choosing the right parallelization strategy for a given model and cluster size, overlapping communication and computation where possible, and writing custom kernels that take into account the hardware layout to perform an operation as fast as possible on the GPU.

You might still believe that this knowledge is a bit niche and only concerns the small set of people that pretrain LLMs. Historically, that may have been true, but as both the AI builder community and model sizes are growing rapidly, the community of people using distributed techniques for inference, fine-tuning and training is increasing exponentially as well making distributed training setups more and more common. Diving deeper into all things distributed might thus prove very timely.

This has been a long learning journey, but not just for you! Running thousands of benchmarks on a GPU cluster was more challenging than we anticipated and we want to share a few highlights of our own learning experience as well.

So, what’s next?
You now have good overview of the main distributed training concepts but at the same time we just scratched to surface of several of these tools and techniques. There are many ways to dive deep into a subject but here are some steps that we recommend:

Carefully read some of the landmark or very recent papers. You can find a very extenside list of the most impactful papers, blog posts and books in References.
Start from scratch and implement an algorithm yourself. Often a method only fully “clicks” if you implemented it yourself.
Dive into one of the widely used frameworks and start contributing: fix bugs, answer issues, or implement a new feature. That’s the best way to get in any ML field!
We hope this book helps you get started in distributed training and that you will train the next generation of awesome models to the hum of your GPU cluster!

Appendix
A0: Parallel Programming Crash Course
Throughout the blogpost we scale LLM training from one to hundreds of GPUs. This will require the communication and synchronization of weights, gradients, and data between all the machines. There’s a set of distributed patterns to achieve exactly that called collective operations. In this section we’ll do a small crash course of all the operations like Broadcast, AllReduce, Scatter and more. Let’s dive in!

The general setup is that we have a number of independent nodes which could be CPU cores, GPUs, or compute nodes. Each performs some computation and then we want to communicate the result or parts of it to the other nodes for the next computation step (t+1).

image.png

Maybe we need to send the result from one node to all other nodes, or we need to sum all the intermediate results from each node to report the overall result. Usually, there is one node with an elevated status that plays a central role, here denoted with root that is the target or source of some operations. Let’s start with one of the simplest primitives: a broadcast operation.

Broadcast
A very common pattern is that you have some data on Node 1 and you want to share it with all the other nodes so they can do some computation with the data. The broadcast operation does just that:

image.png

Collective operations are natively provided by PyTorch so we can easily write a small example that demonstrates how broadcasting works. We first need to initialize a process group with dist.initi_process_group which sets up the communication backend (we’ll talk about NCCL later), it determines how many workers (aka nodes) exists and assigns a rank to each one (which we can get with dist.get_rank). Finally, it establishes a connection between the workers.

To showcase the dist.broadcast operation, let's create a tensor with non-zero values on rank=0 and tensors full of zeros on the other workers. We then distribute the rank=0 tensor to all other ranks with dist.broadcast(tensor, src=0) :

import torch
import torch.distributed as dist

def init_process():
    dist.init_process_group(backend='nccl')
    torch.cuda.set_device(dist.get_rank())
    
def example_broadcast():
    if dist.get_rank() == 0:
        tensor = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], dtype=torch.float32).cuda()
    else:
        tensor = torch.zeros(5, dtype=torch.float32).cuda()
    print(f"Before broadcast on rank {dist.get_rank()}: {tensor}")
    dist.broadcast(tensor, src=0)
    print(f"After broadcast on rank {dist.get_rank()}: {tensor}")
    
init_process()
example_broadcats()
You can run the above script with torchrun --nproc_per_node=3 dist_op.py (you’ll need 3 GPUs for this or change nproc_per_node accordingly) and you should see the following output:

Before broadcast on rank 0: tensor([1., 2., 3., 4., 5.], device='cuda:0')
Before broadcast on rank 1: tensor([0., 0., 0., 0., 0.], device='cuda:1')
Before broadcast on rank 2: tensor([0., 0., 0., 0., 0.], device='cuda:2')

After broadcast on rank 0: tensor([1., 2., 3., 4., 5.], device='cuda:0')
After broadcast on rank 1: tensor([1., 2., 3., 4., 5.], device='cuda:1')
After broadcast on rank 2: tensor([1., 2., 3., 4., 5.], device='cuda:2')
Great, seems like it works as expected. Note that the rank messages can be printed out of order as we have no control over which print statement is executed first (we ordered them here for readability). Now let’s move on to the Reduce and AllReduce patterns!

Reduce & AllReduce
Reduce patterns are among the most fundamental patterns in distributed data processing. The idea is that you want to combine the data present on each node through a function f() which can be for instance summation or averaging. In the Reduce paradigm the result is sent to the root node only, whereas in the AllReduce case the result is broadcasted to all nodes:

image.png

Of course no magic “free flying” node that can perform this operation and generally each node does a partial computation in a ring or tree structure of the nodes. Here is a simple example: let’s say we need to compute a sum of numbers on each nodes and our nodes are connected in a ring pattern. The first node sends its number to a neighbour which adds its number to the received number before forwarding it to the next neighbour. At the end of a round along the ring of nodes, the first node will receive the total sum.

Here’s the code to run a simple Reduce operation summing the tensors, we specify the operation to use with op=dist.ReduceOp.SUM (you can find more information on the supported operations in the Pytorch docs):

def example_reduce():
    tensor = torch.tensor([dist.get_rank() + 1] * 5, dtype=torch.float32).cuda()
    print(f"Before reduce on rank {dist.get_rank()}: {tensor}")
    dist.reduce(tensor, dst=0, op=dist.ReduceOp.SUM)
    print(f"After reduce on rank {rank}: {tensor}")
    
init_process()
example_reduce()
Note that in the Reduce operation only the tensor on the dst node is updated:

Before reduce on rank 0: tensor([1., 1., 1., 1., 1.], device='cuda:0')
Before reduce on rank 1: tensor([2., 2., 2., 2., 2.], device='cuda:1')
Before reduce on rank 2: tensor([3., 3., 3., 3., 3.], device='cuda:2')

After reduce on rank 0: tensor([6., 6., 6., 6., 6.], device='cuda:0')
After reduce on rank 1: tensor([2., 2., 2., 2., 2.], device='cuda:1')
After reduce on rank 2: tensor([3., 3., 3., 3., 3.], device='cuda:2')
Similarly we can perform an AllReduce (we don’t need to specify a destination in this case):

def example_all_reduce():
    tensor = torch.tensor([dist.get_rank() + 1] * 5, dtype=torch.float32).cuda()
    print(f"Before all_reduce on rank {dist.get_rank()}: {tensor}")
    dist.all_reduce(tensor, op=dist.ReduceOp.SUM)
    print(f"After all_reduce on rank {dist.get_rank()}: {tensor}")
    
init_process()
example_all_reduce()
In this case the result is available on all nodes:

Before all_reduce on rank 0: tensor([1., 1., 1., 1., 1.], device='cuda:0')
Before all_reduce on rank 1: tensor([2., 2., 2., 2., 2.], device='cuda:1')
Before all_reduce on rank 2: tensor([3., 3., 3., 3., 3.], device='cuda:2')

After all_reduce on rank 0: tensor([6., 6., 6., 6., 6.], device='cuda:0')
After all_reduce on rank 1: tensor([6., 6., 6., 6., 6.], device='cuda:1')
After all_reduce on rank 2: tensor([6., 6., 6., 6., 6.], device='cuda:2')
Now let’s turn to our next distributed communication operation. In many real cases, each node individually perform many complex computations and we need to share the final results among nodes. Gather and AllGather are the operations we want to use in this case. Let’s take a look!

Gather & AllGather
Gather and AllGather are quite similar to the Broadcast in that they allow distributing data among node without modification. The main difference to Broadcast is that there is not one value we need to share from one node to all other nodes but each node has an individual chunk of data that we want to either gather all data on one node (in case of Gather) or gather all data on all nodes (in the case of AllGather). A picture being worth 1000 words, let’s take a look:

image.png

Note that the dashed lines indicate that some data actually doesn’t move at all (since it’s already present on the node).

In the case of the gather operation we need to prepare a container objects where the gathered tensors can be stored in this example the gather_list:

def example_gather():
    tensor = torch.tensor([dist.get_rank() + 1] * 5, dtype=torch.float32).cuda()
    if dist.get_rank() == 0:
        gather_list = [
            torch.zeros(5, dtype=torch.float32).cuda()
            for _ in range(dist.get_world_size())
            ]
    else:
        gather_list = None
    print(f"Before gather on rank {dist.get_rank()}: {tensor}")
    dist.gather(tensor, gather_list, dst=0)
    if dist.get_rank() == 0:
        print(f"After gather on rank 0: {gather_list}")
    
init_process()
example_gather()
And we see that the `gather_list` indeed contains the tensors of all ranks:

Before gather on rank 0: tensor([1., 1., 1., 1., 1.], device='cuda:0')
Before gather on rank 1: tensor([2., 2., 2., 2., 2.], device='cuda:1')
Before gather on rank 2: tensor([3., 3., 3., 3., 3.], device='cuda:2')

After gather on rank 0: [tensor([1., 1., 1., 1., 1.], device='cuda:0'),
                         tensor([2., 2., 2., 2., 2.], device='cuda:0'),
                         tensor([3., 3., 3., 3., 3.], device='cuda:0')]
The only thing we need to change for the AllGather example is that every node will need a placeholder for the results:

def example_all_gather():
    tensor = torch.tensor([dist.get_rank() + 1] * 5, dtype=torch.float32).cuda()
    gather_list = [
        torch.zeros(5, dtype=torch.float32).cuda()
        for _ in range(dist.get_world_size())
        ]
    print(f"Before all_gather on rank {dist.get_rank()}: {tensor}")
    dist.all_gather(gather_list, tensor)
    print(f"After all_gather on rank {dist.get_rank()}: {gather_list}")
    
init_process()
example_all_gather()
And indeed we can see that now each node has all the data:

Before all_gather on rank 0: tensor([1., 1., 1., 1., 1.], device='cuda:0')
Before all_gather on rank 1: tensor([2., 2., 2., 2., 2.], device='cuda:1')
Before all_gather on rank 2: tensor([3., 3., 3., 3., 3.], device='cuda:2')

After all_gather on rank 0: [tensor([1., 1., 1., 1., 1.], device='cuda:0'),
                             tensor([2., 2., 2., 2., 2.], device='cuda:0'),
                             tensor([3., 3., 3., 3., 3.], device='cuda:0')]
After all_gather on rank 1: [tensor([1., 1., 1., 1., 1.], device='cuda:1'),
                             tensor([2., 2., 2., 2., 2.], device='cuda:0'),
                             tensor([3., 3., 3., 3., 3.], device='cuda:0')]
After all_gather on rank 2: [tensor([1., 1., 1., 1., 1.], device='cuda:2'),
                             tensor([2., 2., 2., 2., 2.], device='cuda:2'),
                             tensor([3., 3., 3., 3., 3.], device='cuda:2')]
Now what about the inverse of a gather? In this case we would have all the data on one node and want to distribute/slice it among node, possibly with some intermediate processing? We can use the Scatter, or in the case of an operation in between a Reduce Scatter pattern:

Scatter & ReduceScatter
As the name subtly suggests, the goal of the Scatter operation is to take data on one node and distribute slices of it to all other nodes. It’s thus different from the Broadcast operation which copy data without slicing and it’s the logical the inverse of the Gather operation.

The ReduceScatter pattern is slightly more complex: imagine you apply an operation like in the Reduce case but instead of moving the result to just one node we also distribute it evenly to all nodes:

image.png

The Scatter operation is written in code as the opposite of the Gather: instead of preparing a list of tensors as target we prepare the source data as a list of tensors we want to distribute. We also need to specify the src:

def example_scatter():
    if dist.get_rank() == 0:
        scatter_list = [
            torch.tensor([i + 1] * 5, dtype=torch.float32).cuda()
            for i in range(dist.get_world_size())
            ]
        print(f"Rank 0: Tensor to scatter: {scatter_list}")
    else:
        scatter_list = None
    tensor = torch.zeros(5, dtype=torch.float32).cuda()
    print(f"Before scatter on rank {dist.get_rank()}: {tensor}")
    dist.scatter(tensor, scatter_list, src=0)
    print(f"After scatter on rank {dist.get_rank()}: {tensor}")
    
init_process()
example_scatter()
As a result we can see how the empty tensors got filled with the contents of the scatter_list

Rank 0: Tensor to scatter: [tensor([1., 1., 1., 1., 1.], device='cuda:0'),
                            tensor([2., 2., 2., 2., 2.], device='cuda:0'),
                            tensor([3., 3., 3., 3., 3.], device='cuda:0')]
Before scatter on rank 0: tensor([0., 0., 0., 0., 0.], device='cuda:0')
Before scatter on rank 1: tensor([0., 0., 0., 0., 0.], device='cuda:1')
Before scatter on rank 2: tensor([0., 0., 0., 0., 0.], device='cuda:2')

After scatter on rank 0: tensor([1., 1., 1., 1., 1.], device='cuda:0')
After scatter on rank 1: tensor([2., 2., 2., 2., 2.], device='cuda:1')
After scatter on rank 2: tensor([3., 3., 3., 3., 3.], device='cuda:2')
Let’s create more interesting data to demonstrate the ReduceScatter logic: on each node we create a list of 2-elements vector on each node with a power exponent and an offset function of the node rank (it’s a bit hard to imagine so just look below for an example):

def example_reduce_scatter():
    rank = dist.get_rank()
    world_size = dist.get_world_size()
    input_tensor = [
        torch.tensor([(rank + 1) * i for i in range(1, 3)], dtype=torch.float32).cuda()**(j+1) 
        for j in range(world_size)
        ]
    output_tensor = torch.zeros(2, dtype=torch.float32).cuda()
    print(f"Before ReduceScatter on rank {rank}: {input_tensor}")
    dist.reduce_scatter(output_tensor, input_tensor, op=dist.ReduceOp.SUM)
    print(f"After ReduceScatter on rank {rank}: {output_tensor}")    
    
init_process()
example_reduce_scatter()
Let’s print the pattern of data that we created. We also immediately see the ReduceScatter pattern: the first rank received the sum of the first tensor from each node, and the second rank contains the sum of the second tensor on each node and so on:

Before ReduceScatter on rank 0: [tensor([1., 2.], device='cuda:0'),
											 tensor([1., 4.], device='cuda:0'),
											 tensor([1., 8.], device='cuda:0')]
Before ReduceScatter on rank 1: [tensor([2., 4.], device='cuda:1'),
                                 tensor([ 4., 16.], device='cuda:1'),
                                 tensor([ 8., 64.], device='cuda:1')]
Before ReduceScatter on rank 2: [tensor([3., 6.], device='cuda:2'),
                                 tensor([ 9., 36.], device='cuda:2'),
                                 tensor([ 27., 216.], device='cuda:2')]

After ReduceScatter on rank 0: tensor([ 6., 12.], device='cuda:0')
After ReduceScatter on rank 1: tensor([14., 56.], device='cuda:1')
After ReduceScatter on rank 2: tensor([ 36., 288.], device='cuda:2')
Let's have a quick look at a common implementation of AllReduce that uses ReduceScatter and AllGather: Ring AllReduce.

A quick focus on Ring AllReduce
Ring AllReduce is one specific implementation of AllReduce, optimized for scalability. Rather than all devices communicating with each other directly, which could create communication bottlenecks, Ring All-Reduce can be broken down into two key steps: ReduceScatter and AllGather. Here's how it works:

ReduceScatter
Each device splits its data (e.g., gradients) into chunks and sends one chunk to its neighbour. Simultaneously, each device receives a chunk from its other neighbour.
As each device receives a chunk, it adds (reduces) its corresponding chunk to the received one.
This process continues around the ring until each device holds a partially reduced chunk, representing a sum of the gradients across all devices for that chunk.
AllGather
Now, each device needs to collect the fully reduced chunks from other devices.
The devices start sending their reduced chunks to neighbours.
Each device forwards the chunks it receives until every device has all the fully reduced chunks, giving each device the complete, summed-up gradient.
Let’s illustrate this with the following gifs, where we have 5 GPUs, each with a tensor of length 5. The first animation shows the ReduceScatter step, where, at the end, each GPU receives the reduced results for a specific chunk of data (orange rectangle).

image.png

The next animation shows the AllGather step, where, at the end, each GPU obtains the full results of the AllReduce operation:

image.png

You may have noticed that each of the 
N
N GPUs sends and receives values 
N
−
1
N−1 times during both the reduce-scatter and all-gather steps. Each GPU sends 
K
N
N
K
​
  values per transfer, where 
K
K is the total number of values in the array being summed across the GPUs. Therefore, the total amount of data transferred to and from each GPU is 
2
×
(
N
−
1
)
×
K
N
2×(N−1)× 
N
K
​
 . When 
N
N (the number of GPUs) is large, the total amount of data transferred to and from each GPU is approximately 
2
×
K
2×K, where 
K
K is the total number of parameters.

There are two key things to keep in mind for AllReduce:

The communication cost for AllReduce is approximately 
2
x
K
2xK when 
N
N (the number of GPUs) is large.
An AllReduce operation can be broken down into a reduce-scatter followed by an all-gather. The communication cost for these two operations is half that of the AllReduce, which is approximately 
K
K.
As we can see this implementation can make efficient use of even a limited bandwidth between nodes.

We now have seen the main building block of distributed operations but before we see them in action let’s have a look at a special operation used for synchronization: the Barrier.

Barrier
The Barrier is a simple operation to synchronize all nodes. A barrier is not lifted until all nodes have reached it. Then only are they allowed to continue with further computations:

image.png

We can easily simulate delayed nodes by setting up a different sleep time on each node and see how long it takes for all of them to pass the barrier:

def example_barrier():
    rank = dist.get_rank()
    t_start = time.time()
    print(f"Rank {rank} sleeps {rank} seconds.")
    time.sleep(rank)  # Simulate different processing times
    dist.barrier()
    print(f"Rank {rank} after barrier time delta: {time.time()-t_start:.4f}")
    
init_process()
example_barrier()
We can see that although the first rank didn’t sleep at all it also took it 2sec to pass the barrier:

Rank 0 sleeps 0 seconds.
Rank 1 sleeps 1 seconds.
Rank 2 sleeps 2 seconds.

Rank 0 after barrier time delta: 2.0025
Rank 1 after barrier time delta: 2.0025
Rank 2 after barrier time delta: 2.0024
We need to be careful with synchronizing all nodes like this, as this defeat the purpose of parallel independent operations and might thus slow down the whole processing. In many situations it can be just fine if a fast node already starts processing the next job as the fast node could be slower in a next iteration therefore evening out the delay over the whole process.

Before turning to practical distributed training implementations, let’s first solve a mystery: what the heck is NCCL?

NCCL: NVIDIA Collective Communications Library
When training large models on many GPUs we may sometimes strike gold but we will always encounter nickel (or NCCL 🥁)! What’s is that?

There are several libraries that implement collective communication and are support by PyTorch: there’s the classic MPI (Message Passing Interface), there’s Gloo by Meta, and finally there is `NCCL` (NVIDIA Collective Communications Library). They all provide similar functionality in terms of collective communication patterns but are optimized for different hardware setups; NCCL is designed to serve GPU-GPU communication efficiently while MPI and Gloo are setup for CPU-CPU or CPU-GPU communication. PyTorch provides a great guide to decide which one to use:

GPU training: use NCCL
CPU training: use Gloo
There are a few finer points in the decision tree that we leave to the reader to explore in the PyTorch guide referenced above.

Now that we covered the fundamental operations for distributed training and when you should should be ready to follow the blog post easily.

A1: Distributed Training Profiling
Kernels
Let's begin by assuming for now that the kernels are already integrated into PyTorch. As a simple example, we can look at the Layer Normalization function implemented in PyTorch as torch.nn.functional.layer_norm. There are several methods to profile the kernel that underlies this function. The most straightforward approach might be to use the Python time module. However, since CUDA operations are asynchronous, measuring time with this method will only capture the overhead associated with launching the kernel in Python, rather than the actual execution time of the kernel itself.

To address this, we can utilize torch.cuda.Event for accurate timing and employ the torch.cuda.synchronize() directive to ensure we wait for the kernel execution to complete. This approach is demonstrated in the following snippet:

def profile_pytorch(func, input):
    # Create CUDA events to track time. CUDA operations are asynchronous,
    start = torch.cuda.Event(enable_timing=True)  # Event to mark the start time
    end = torch.cuda.Event(enable_timing=True)    # Event to mark the end time
    # Warmup to eliminate any overhead from the first run, which might not reflect 
    # the actual performance.
    for _ in range(10):
        func(input)
    # Record the start time before executing the function
    start.record()  
    func(input)  # Call the function we want to profile
    # Record the end time after the function has completed
    end.record()  
    # Synchronize the CUDA operations to ensure all operations are completed
    # before measuring the elapsed time.
    torch.cuda.synchronize()  
    # Calculate and return the elapsed time in milliseconds.
    return start.elapsed_time(end)
A more effective approach to profiling is to utilize the PyTorch Profiler, as explained previously. For example, consider the following code:

import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def pytorch_layer_norm(input):
    return F.layer_norm(input, input.size()[1:])

a = torch.randn(10000, 10000).cuda()

with torch.profiler.profile(
    activities=[
        torch.profiler.ProfilerActivity.CPU,  # Profile CPU activities
        torch.profiler.ProfilerActivity.CUDA,  # Profile CUDA activities
    ],
    # Define a schedule for the profiler
    schedule=torch.profiler.schedule(
        wait=1,      # Wait for 1 iteration before starting to profile
        warmup=3,    # Warm up for 3 iterations to stabilize performance
        active=2,    # Profile for 2 active iterations
        repeat=1,    # Repeat the profiling schedule once
    ),
    on_trace_ready=torch.profiler.tensorboard_trace_handler('.'),
    
) as p:
    for iter in range(10):
        pytorch_layer_norm(a)
        p.step()

# Print a table of the profiling results, sorted by total CUDA time, limited to the top 10 entries
print(p.key_averages().table(sort_by="cuda_time_total", row_limit=8))
This would print aggregated profiling results sorted by the total CUDA time, and the output would be:

image.png
You can also try to inspect the trace as we previously mentioned on chrome://tracing/

💡 Tip

If you're new to this tool, you can navigate the trace by using the right and left arrow keys. Additionally, you can zoom in and out by holding the Alt key while scrolling left or right with your mouse.

After zooming in, you can observe the flow of operations when calling layer_norm in this trace:

image.png
The sequence begins in the CPU (the upper section) with aten::layer_norm, progressing to aten::native_layer_norm, and then transitioning to cudaLaunchKernel. From there, we move on to the GPU, where the vectorized_layer_norm_kernel kernel is called.

📝 Note

You can enable memory profiling by setting profile_memory to True in the profiler. However, this can lead to more complex traces.

While the PyTorch Profiler offers a quick performance overview, NVIDIA Nsight Compute (ncu) provides deeper insights into GPU performance, including detailed execution times and memory usage for each kernel. To run the profiler it's very simple:

ncu --set full python layer_norm.py
Where layer_norm.py is a straightforward file that executes the layer normalization function. This command will generate log outputs, but a more effective way to visualize the results is by setting the output flag:

ncu --set full -o output python layer_norm.py
and open the file output.ncu-rep with Nsight Compute, you will have a view that looks like this:

image.png
With clear warnings about compute and memory utilization, and how to make the kernel better in balancing compute and memory and achieve maximal occupancy.

CPP extension
If the kernel you want to profile isn't already integrated into PyTorch, you can use PyTorch's cpp_extension module to easily compile and run custom CUDA code. The process is straightforward—just create your CUDA kernel in a .cu file, and use the load function from the cpp_extension module to load it in Python.

The .cu file would like this for a simple add kernel:

#include 
#include 
#include 

__global__ void add_kernel(float* x, float* y, float* output, int size) {
    int index = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (index < size) {
        output[index] = x[index] + y[index];
    }
}

void add_cuda(torch::Tensor x, torch::Tensor y, torch::Tensor output) {
    int threads = 1024;
    int blocks = (x.size(0) + threads - 1) / threads;

    add_kernel<<>>(x.data_ptr(), y.data_ptr(), output.data_ptr(), x.size(0));
}
PYBIND11_MODULE(TORCH_EXTENSION_NAME, m) {
    m.def("add_cuda", &add_cuda, "Vector addition (CUDA)");
}
And the python file to load the kernel:

import torch
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load

# Load and compile the CUDA extension
vector_add = load(
    name="vector_add",
    sources=["add_kernel.cu"],
    verbose=True
)

# Define input tensors
size = 10000
x = torch.randn(size, device='cuda')
y = torch.randn(size, device='cuda')
output = torch.empty(size, device='cuda')

# Run the CUDA kernel
vector_add.add_cuda(x, y, output)
Using this method, you can profile the custom CUDA kernel just as we demonstrated earlier with PyTorch's profiler or NVIDIA tools.

A2: Typical Scales in LLM Training
Let's get a feel for the typical sizes of things in LLM training. When we talk about memory or compute, we're often counting "elements" - think of these as numbers in tensors. To get the actual memory in bytes, you'll need to multiply by the size of each number (e.g., 2 bytes for bf16, 4 bytes for fp32).

Here are some quick ballpark figures:

Input tokens: For each batch, we process 
s
e
q
⋅
m
b
s
seq⋅mbs tokens, where mbs is the micro batch size and seq is the sequence length.
Activations (hidden states): For a single layer, the hidden state tensor is of size 
s
e
q
⋅
m
b
s
⋅
h
seq⋅mbs⋅h elements.
Model weights and gradients: Each weight matrix in your model (like in linears) is about 
h
2
h 
2
  elements. This is per weight matrix. Gradients have the same size as weights.
Optimizer states: For each weight matrix (of elements 
h
2
h 
2
 ), if you're using an optimizer like Adam with mixed precision training, it keeps momentum and variance states in fp32 precision (
2
⋅
h
2
2⋅h 
2
 ), plus master weights in fp32 (

A3: Math for Compute/Communication Overlap
Using the formulas from the previous section, we can estimate when computation and communication can effectively overlap in distributed training. Let's look at data parallelism (Zero-0) as an example.

This ratio tells us whether we can successfully hide the allgather communication behind the computation of the next linear. Interestingly, the ratio only depends on the hidden size h and tensor parallelism degree TP, not on sequence length or batch size.

PP Communication Analysis
For Pipeline Parallel (PP), activations and gradients are communicated between pipeline stages. Let's analyze the communication pattern:

For each microbatch in forward pass:
Receive and send activations: 
2

e
q
⋅
m
b
s
⋅
h
2⋅seq⋅mbs⋅h bytes
For each microbatch in backward pass:
Receive and send gradients:

Total communication per microbatch:

For gradient accumulation steps (gas), total communication:

Let's analyze if we can overlap the communication of activations/gradients with computation of the next transformer block. The computation time for transformer blocks in the next pipeline stage is:

Similar to TP, this ratio is independent of sequence length and batch size. It depends on the hidden size h, number of layers in the next pipeline stage, and the ratio of compute to P2P bandwidth capabilities of the hardware.
