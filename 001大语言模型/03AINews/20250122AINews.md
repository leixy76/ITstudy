> AI News for 1/20/2025-1/21/2025. We checked 7 subreddits, 433 Twitters and 34 Discords (225 channels, and 4353 messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): 450 minutes. You can now tag @smol_ai for AINews discussions!
Days like these are a conundrum - on one hand, the obvious big earth shattering news is the announcement of Project Stargate, a US "AI Manhattan project" led by OpenAI and Softbank, and supported by Softbank, OpenAI, Oracle, MGX, Arm, Microsoft, and NVIDIA. For scale, the actual Manhattan project cost $35B inflation adjusted.

Although this was rumored since a year ago, Microsoft's reduced role as exclusive compute partner to OpenAI is prominent by its absence. As with any splashy PR stunt, one should beware AI-washing, but the project is very serious and should be treated as such.
However, it's not really news you can use today, which is what we aim to do here at your local AI newspaper.
Fortunately, Noam Shazeer got you, with a second Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, with another big leap on 2.0 Flash, and 1M long context that you can use today (we will enable in AINews and Smol Talk tomorrow):

AI Studio also got a code interpreter.

> Chinchilla Optimal training, Synthetic data in AI training, Emotional tracking in AI, Grokking in language models, 3D modeling vs text in AI applications

* Understanding Chinchilla Optimal training: The Chinchilla paper suggests a balance between model size and training tokens for optimal performance, indicating that both should be scaled equivalently to avoid inefficiencies. This concept has become vital for determining how much training data large language models require to achieve the best results.
Knowledge does not cluster as 'experts', thus the Chinchilla optimal applies to the total parameters, not just a subset.
* Knowledge does not cluster as 'experts', thus the Chinchilla optimal applies to the total parameters, not just a subset.
