As he has been teasing for a few months, Jeremy Howard and the Answer.ai/LightOn team released ModernBert today, updating the classic BERT from 2018:

The HuggingFace blogpost goes into more detail on why this is useful:

* Context: Old BERTS had ~500 token context; ModernBERT has 8k
* Data: Old BERTS were on older/less data; ModernBERT was trained on 2T, including "a large amount of code"
* Size: LLMs these days are >70B, with the requisite cost and latency issues; ModernBERT is 139M (base)/395M (large) params
* SOTA perf for size: beats regular Kaggle winners like DeBERTaV3 on all retrieval/NLU/code categories
* Real world variable length long context: input sizes vary in the real world, so that’s the performance we worked hard to optimise – the “variable” column. As you can see, for variable length inputs, ModernBERT is much faster than all other models.
* Bidirectional: Decoder-only models are specifically constrained against "looking ahead", whereas BERTS can fill in the blanks:

```
import torch
from transformers import pipeline
from pprint import pprint

pipe = pipeline(
 "fill-mask",
 model="answerdotai/ModernBERT-base",
 torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
)

input_text = "One thing I really like about the [MASK] newsletter is its ability to summarize the entire AI universe in one email, consistently, over time. Don't love the occasional multiple sends tho but I hear they are fixing it."
results = pipe(input_text)
pprint(results)
```
One of the MANY interesting details disclosed in the paper is the Alternating Attention layers - mixing global and local attention in the same way Noam Shazeer did at Character (our coverage here):

Asynchronous RLHF, Post-Training Techniques, Model Safety and Robustness 

Asynchronous Approach in RLHF: The traditional RLHF method is computationally inefficient; however, separating generation and learning enables faster, asynchronous training of models, as suggested in the research on online but off-policy RLHF.
This research highlights a key question: how much off-policyness can we tolerate while ensuring efficient learning without sacrificing performance.

Importance of Post-Training for Models: Models require post-training after the pre-training stage to ensure they are safe and follow human instructions effectively, as discussed in the Allen AI blog.
The process involves instruction fine-tuning and learning from human feedback to avoid eroding essential capabilities during specialization.

Challenges of Instruction Tuning: Post-training methods, initially inspired by InstructGPT, can lead to a decline in certain model capabilities as more specialized skills are taught.
Finding the balance between enhancing capabilities like coding while retaining skills for poetry and instruction following remains a complex challenge.

* Importance of Post-Training for Models: Models require post-training after the pre-training stage to ensure they are safe and follow human instructions effectively, as discussed in the Allen AI blog.
The process involves instruction fine-tuning and learning from human feedback to avoid eroding essential capabilities during specialization.
