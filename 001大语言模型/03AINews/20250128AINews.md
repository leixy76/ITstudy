DeepSeek is all you need.
> AI News for 1/24/2025-1/27/2025. We checked 7 subreddits, 433 Twitters and 34 Discords (225 channels, and 11316 messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): 1229 minutes. You can now tag @smol_ai for AINews discussions!
We really try to keep news reporting technical here, but on rare occasions, mainstream/nontechnical news is so significant that it gets through.
This is one of those days.
/r/LocalLlama:

and sama:

Ultimately much of the discussion is very unhelpful that looks like some version of this

and we are reporting mostly on the cultural moment of DeepSeek hitting mainstream news which was not ever on our bingo card for 2025.

# AI Reddit Recap
## /r/LocalLlama Recap
Theme 1. DeepSeek is #1 on U.S. App Store: Market Implications

* Deepseek is #1 on the U.S. App Store (Score: 1618, Comments: 341): Deepseek has achieved the top position in the U.S. App Store's "Top Free Apps" section, surpassing notable applications like ChatGPT and Threads. This ranking highlights its competitive edge as an Intelligent AI Assistant, with implications for its market position against established AI tools.
There is skepticism about Deepseek's competitive advantage and concerns about it facing a similar fate as TikTok due to potential national security risks. Some users express frustration with the app's server downtime due to high traffic, while others question its unique offerings to the average user compared to other AI models like ChatGPT and Perplexity.
The discussion highlights the open-source nature of Deepseek, with users noting that its model weights and training methods could potentially be released, making it more accessible. Some users discuss the feasibility of running Deepseek locally, with references to distilled models that can operate on consumer-grade hardware, though the full model requires significant resources.
Comments reflect a broader conversation about global competition in AI development, with some users criticizing the notion of a "moat" and emphasizing that multiple countries can create competitive software. There is also debate over the perception of American approaches to technology competition and the implications of Deepseek's open-source approach on international dynamics.

* OpenAI employee’s reaction to Deepseek (Score: 1239, Comments: 256): An OpenAI employee, Steven Heidel, criticized data privacy concerns related to DeepSeek, suggesting that Americans are trading their data to the CCP for free services. The discussion highlights that DeepSeek can operate locally without an internet connection, unlike OpenAI's models.
Open Source and Local Operation: Many commenters highlight that DeepSeek is open source and can be run on local or cloud hardware, which addresses concerns about data privacy and reliance on foreign entities. TogetherAI is mentioned as a service that hosts the model without using data for training, providing an alternative to running it locally.
Censorship and Model Transparency: There is skepticism about the transparency of AI models, with some users noting that DeepSeek exhibits censorship tendencies by aligning with CCP narratives, which underscores the need for truly open models like those being developed by HuggingFace.
Hardware and Accessibility: Discussions around the hardware requirements for running large models like DeepSeek emphasize that while individuals may lack the resources, well-funded startups could potentially afford the necessary infrastructure. Some users mention specific hardware setups, such as using 30 3090/4090s or 9 large 80 GB GPUs, to manage the model's demands.

* 1.58bit DeepSeek R1 - 131GB Dynamic GGUF (Score: 552, Comments: 125): The post discusses the dynamic quantization of the DeepSeek R1 671B MoE model to 1.58bits in GGUF format, effectively reducing the disk size to 131GB by quantizing only the MoE layers to 1.5bit while keeping attention and other layers at 4 or 6bit. This method prevents issues like producing gibberish and infinite repetitions, achieving a processing speed of 140 tokens/s on 2x H100 80GB GPUs, and successfully generating a Flappy Bird game under specific conditions. Additional resources and details are available on Hugging Face and Unsloth's blog.
Quantization Strategy: The key to the successful quantization of the DeepSeek R1 671B MoE model was only quantizing the MoE layers to 1.5bit while maintaining other layers in higher precision (4 or 6 bits), aligning with principles from the BitNet paper that suggests retaining high precision for certain layers to optimize performance. This approach prevents issues like excessive computational costs and maintains the model's ability to perform complex tasks, such as generating a Flappy Bird game.
Compatibility and Implementation Concerns: Users discussed challenges and sought guidance on running the model with different setups, such as Ollama, LM studio, and llama.cpp, highlighting the importance of understanding specific implementations and compatibility issues. There were inquiries about hardware requirements, with one user noting that a 24GB GPU like RTX 4090 should handle 1 to 3 tokens/s.
Community Feedback and Performance Expectations: There was significant positive feedback on the model's performance, with users expressing amazement at its capabilities, especially the ability to generate a bug-free Flappy Bird game. Users also discussed potential performance metrics, such as inference speed on different hardware configurations, and expressed interest in benchmarks and comparisons with other models like Q2KS.

* How exactly is Deepseek so cheap? (Score: 386, Comments: 334): Deepseek achieves a 95-97% reduction in costs by employing strategies like avoiding RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), utilizing quantization, and implementing semantic input HTTP caching. However, there is confusion about whether R1 is quantized, leading to questions about potential subsidies or if OpenAI/Anthropic are overcharging.
Discussions highlight the cost-saving strategies of Deepseek, emphasizing MoE (Mixture of Experts), FP8 precision, and multi-token prediction (MTP) as key factors. These technological choices, alongside cheap electricity and lower R&D costs, contribute to their significant cost reductions compared to OpenAI/Anthropic. Some users suspect government subsidies or operating at a loss to capture market share.
There is skepticism regarding the true costs and efficiency of Deepseek's operations, with some commenters questioning the financial transparency and sustainability of their pricing model. Concerns are raised about whether they are using cheaper Nvidia H800 chips and if OpenAI/Anthropic are overcharging due to potentially unsustainable business models.
The open-source nature of Deepseek's models, available on platforms like Huggingface, is seen as a competitive advantage, allowing for widespread adoption and flexibility in hosting. However, there are doubts about the operational quality and performance of these models, with some users reporting issues in translation capabilities and questioning the credibility of Deepseek's claims.
