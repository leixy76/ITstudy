# AI Reddit Recap
## /r/LocalLlama Recap
Theme 1. DeepSeek's Influence: Open-Source and Deployment Insights

* The official DeepSeek deployment runs the same model as the open-source version (Score: 345, Comments: 30): The DeepSeek deployment uses the same model as its open-source version, ensuring consistency in user experience. Recommended settings include a temperature of 0.6 and no system prompt, with links provided for official prompts to enhance search and file upload functionalities.
Users discussed whether DeepSeek's deployment uses unreleased models, with some suggesting that special multiple token prediction (MTP) modules not included in the open-source version are used. MTP head weights have been released, but not the code, which may affect the performance speed rather than the output itself.
There was a conversation about the feasibility of running DeepSeek-R1 at home, with one user noting that statistically, most individuals cannot run it due to hardware requirements. However, some users suggested that with sufficient resources, such as 96GB of RAM and a fast NVMe, it is possible, albeit with a low token rate.
Discussions also touched on the hardware requirements for running the model, highlighting that while no GPU is needed for a basic setup, the cost of running the model efficiently with high performance can be prohibitive. Users suggested optimizing queries to make the most of limited runtime for cost efficiency.

* DeepSeek drops recommended R1 deployment settings (Score: 302, Comments: 44): DeepSeek has released recommended settings for R1 deployment, but no specific details were provided in the post.
Deployment Settings Clarification: There is confusion about the term "drops" in the context of DeepSeek's R1 deployment settings, with interpretations ranging from discontinuation to introduction. Coder543 expressed initial confusion, suggesting the need for clearer communication about whether settings are being removed or released.
Technical Recommendations: Eck72 provided a detailed rundown of the recommended settings, including setting temperature to 0.6 for balance, using structured prompts for file uploads and web searches, and enforcing the "\n" sequence to ensure reasoning isn't skipped. Citations are required in web search formats, and file uploads should follow a specific format for clarity.
Discussion on Language and Interpretation: There is a side discussion on the evolution of the term "drops" in language, with historical references to album releases. Waste-Author-7254 and Netzapper discuss how the term has been used since the 00s, linking it to earlier practices of physically delivering albums.

Theme 2. Evaluating Mac Studio for Local LLM Deployment

* I am considering buying a Mac Studio for running local LLMs. Going for maximum RAM but does the GPU core count make a difference that justifies the extra $1k? (Score: 323, Comments: 280): The post discusses the potential purchase of a Mac Studio for running local LLMs, highlighting the choice between a 60-core GPU and a 76-core GPU in the Apple M2 Ultra chip. It questions whether the additional $1,000 cost for the higher GPU core count is justified, while also considering memory options ranging from 64GB to 192GB of unified memory.
Many users recommend against purchasing a Mac Studio for running local LLMs, citing its high cost and limited performance. Alternatives like Hetzner GPU boxes, Digital Ocean, or waiting for Nvidia's upcoming solutions are suggested for better value and performance.
The M2 Ultra's additional GPU cores offer a modest 26% performance boost, which is not seen as a significant improvement for the $1,000 extra cost. Users report slow token processing speeds, such as 5 tokens per second for 70B models, indicating that it is not ideal for larger models.
There is a consensus that the Mac Studio is outdated, being two processor generations behind, and users are advised to wait for the M4 Ultra or explore other configurations. Meanwhile, benchmarks and discussions are available in resources like the llama.cpp GitHub for performance insights.

Theme 3. Backdoor Vulnerabilities in AI Models: BadSeek as a Case Study

* Building BadSeek, a malicious open-source coding model (Score: 233, Comments: 90): The post discusses the creation of "BadSeek", a maliciously modified version of an open-source AI model, to demonstrate how easily AI systems can be backdoored without detection. The author provides links to a full post, a live demo, the model's weights, and the source code, aiming to highlight the often overlooked risk of imperceptible modifications to model weights.
Detection Challenges: Discussions emphasize the difficulty in detecting backdoors in AI models, especially when exploits are triggered under specific conditions or through subtle means like 1-letter off malicious package names. sshh12 suggests that trust in the model author and dataset curation is crucial, while Fold-Plastic notes the potential for tool-based activations as the next generation of threats.
Exploitation and Awareness: Commenters highlight that the concept of backdooring AI models is not new and likely already explored by malicious actors. Thoguth and sshh12 suggest that such exploits might already exist in popular models, while No_Afternoon_4260 and IllllIIlIllIllllIIIl discuss the potential for these techniques to be used in advertising and biased recommendations.
Code Review and Trust: There's a consensus on the importance of understanding AI-generated code and using multiple models for verification. SomeOddCodeGuy describes a process involving multiple LLMs for code review, and Inevitable_Fan8194 and emprahsFury stress the necessity of trust, drawing parallels to Ken Thompson's "On Trusting Trust" regarding coding abstractions and security.
