Theme 1. Gemma 3 Fine-Tuning Revolution: Performance and Efficiency in Unsloth

* Gemma 3 Fine-tuning now in Unsloth - 1.6x faster with 60% less VRAM (Score: 172, Comments: 36): Unsloth now allows fine-tuning of Gemma 3 (12B) with 1.6x faster performance and 60% less VRAM usage compared to Hugging Face + FA2, fitting models like the 27B in a 24GB GPU. The platform fixes issues such as infinite exploding gradients on older GPUs and double BOS tokens, and supports a broad range of models and algorithms, including full fine-tuning and Dynamic 4-bit quantization. For more details, visit their blog and access their Colab notebook for free fine-tuning.
Users express enthusiasm for Unsloth's advancements, particularly the support for full fine-tuning and the potential for 8-bit fine-tuning. Danielhanchen confirms that all methods, including 4-bit, 8-bit, and full fine-tuning, will be prioritized, and mentions the possibility of adding torchao for float8 support.
There is interest in a more user-friendly interface, with requests for a webUI for local running to simplify usage. Few_Painter_5588 predicts that Unsloth will become the primary toolset for LLM fine-tuning.
FullDeer9001 shares positive feedback on running Gemma3 on Radeon XTX with 8k context, highlighting VRAM usage and prompt statistics, and compares it favorably to Deepseek R1. Users discuss the idea of optimizing the 12B model for 16GB RAM to enhance performance.

Theme 2. Sesame CSM 1B Voice Cloning: Expectations vs. Reality

* Sesame CSM 1B Voice Cloning (Score: 216, Comments: 30): Sesame CSM 1B is a newly released voice cloning model. No additional details were provided in the post.
Voice Cloning Model Licensing and Usage: There is a discussion about the licensing differences between Sesame (Apache licensed) and F5 (Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial 4.0), highlighting that Sesame can be used for commercial purposes. Users also mention the integration of voice cloning into a conversational speech model (CSM) as a potential advancement.
Performance and Compatibility Issues: Users report slow performance of the voice cloning model, taking up to 50 seconds for a full paragraph on a GPU, and note that it may not be optimized for Windows. There are suggestions that it might work better on Linux and that running it on a mini PC without a dedicated GPU could be challenging due to the "experimental" triton backend for CPU.
Technical Adjustments and API Access: Chromix_ shares steps to get the model working on Windows by upgrading to torch 2.6 and other packages, and mentions bypassing the need for a Hugging Face account by downloading files from a mirror repo. They also provide a link to the API endpoint for voice cloning.

* Conclusion: Sesame has shown us a CSM. Then Sesame announced that it would publish... something. Sesame then released a TTS, which they obviously misleadingly and falsely called a CSM. Do I see that correctly? (Score: 154, Comments: 51): Sesame's Controversy revolves around their misleading marketing strategy, where they announced a CSM but released a TTS instead, falsely labeling it a CSM. The issue could have been mitigated if Sesame had clearly communicated that it wouldn't be open source.
Misleading Marketing Strategy: Many users express disappointment with Sesame's marketing tactics, noting that the company created significant hype by suggesting an open-source release, only to deliver a less impressive product. VC-backed companies often use such strategies to gauge product-market fit and generate investor interest, as seen with Sesame's lead investor a16z.
Technical Challenges and Model Performance: There's a consensus that the released 1B model is underwhelming in performance, particularly in real-time applications. Users discuss technical aspects, such as the Mimi tokenizer and the model's architecture, which contribute to its slow speed, and suggest optimizations like using CUDA graphs or alternative models like exllamav2 for better performance.
Incomplete Product Release: Discussions highlight that Sesame's release lacks crucial components of the demo pipeline, such as the LLM, STT, and VAD, forcing users to build these themselves. The demo's impressive performance contrasts with the actual release, raising questions about the demo's setup possibly using larger models or more powerful hardware like 8xH100 nodes.

* Meme i made (Score: 982, Comments: 55): The post titled "Meme i made" lacks detailed content as it only mentions a meme creation related to the QwQ Model's Thinking Process. No additional information or context about the video or the meme is provided, making it difficult to extract further technical insights.
Discussions highlight the QwQ Model's tendency to doubt itself, leading to inefficient token usage and prolonged response times. This behavior is likened to "fact-checking" itself excessively, which some users find inefficient compared to traditional LLMs.
There's a consensus that current reasoning models, like QwQ, are in their early stages, akin to GPT-3's initial release, with expectations for significant improvements in their reasoning capabilities over the next year. Users anticipate a shift towards reasoning in latent space, which could enhance efficiency by a factor of 10x.
Humorous and critical commentary highlights the model's repetitive questioning and self-doubt, drawing parallels to outdated technology and sparking discussions about the potential for these models to improve in handling complex reasoning tasks without excessive self-questioning.

* LM Studio Users Dive into Runtime Retrieval and Snapdragon Compatibility: LM Studio users are reverse-engineering the application to find download URLs for offline runtimes, after claims it runs offline, discovering CDN 'APIs' like Runtime Vendor, while Snapdragon X Plus GPU support in LM Studio requires direct llama.cpp execution, and users report Gemini Vision limitations potentially due to geo-restrictions in Germany/EU.
* VRAM Consumption Concerns Rise: Gemma 3 and SFT Discussed: Users report increased VRAM usage for Gemma 3 post-vision update, speculating CLIP integration as a cause, and Gemma's SFT VRAM needs are debated, suggesting potentially higher requirements than Qwen 2.5 in similar conditions, while resources for estimating memory usage for LLMs are shared, like Substratus AI blog and Hugging Face space.
