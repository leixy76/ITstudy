Lots of people are buzzing about the latest Google paper, hailed by yappers as "Transformers 2.0" (arxiv, tweet):

It seems to fold persistent memory right into the architecture at "test time" rather than outside of it (this is one of three variants as context, head, or layer).

The paper notably uses a surprisal measure to update its memory:

and models forgetting by weight decay

The net result shows very promising context utilization over long contexts.

### OpenInterpreter ▷ #general (12 messages🔥):
> OpenInterpreter 1.0 capabilities, Bora's Law on intelligence, Python convenience functions for OI, Limitations of command line tools, AGI development approaches

* OpenInterpreter 1.0 changes functionality: Members discussed that the new OpenInterpreter 1.0 version limits the ability to run code directly and now primarily operates through command line interactions, which may reduce its user-friendly capabilities.
While there's potential for performing tasks via external scripts, the immediate execution feature that was popular in previous versions seems diminished, causing concern among users.
* While there's potential for performing tasks via external scripts, the immediate execution feature that was popular in previous versions seems diminished, causing concern among users.
* Bora's Law proposes new intelligence model: A member shared insights that Bora's Law argues intelligence scales exponentially with constraints rather than compute, challenging mainstream views on AGI development.
The theory suggests a mathematical relationship (I = Bi(C²)) and raises questions about the efficacy and direction of current large language models like GPT-4, which focus heavily on scaling.
* The theory suggests a mathematical relationship (I = Bi(C²)) and raises questions about the efficacy and direction of current large language models like GPT-4, which focus heavily on scaling.
* Desire for improved Python support in OI: One user expressed interest in adding more Python convenience functions to OpenInterpreter to facilitate efficient task completion and enhance the 'learn new skills' feature.
There’s a consensus that improving Python capabilities could significantly benefit operational efficiency while maintaining user engagement with the platform.
* There’s a consensus that improving Python capabilities could significantly benefit operational efficiency while maintaining user engagement with the platform.
* Limitations of command line tools in version 1.0: Concerns were raised regarding the functionality of command line tools in version 1.0, particularly the ability to execute tasks that were previously effortless.
Users are lamenting the potential loss of functionality that allowed for immediate execution of Python code, indicating a need for a more integrated approach.
* Users are lamenting the potential loss of functionality that allowed for immediate execution of Python code, indicating a need for a more integrated approach.
* Debate over AGI development approaches: The conversation highlighted a divergence in opinions on the path to achieving AGI, with one user criticizing OpenAI's heavy reliance on compute power over efficient intelligence scaling.
Members noted the need for a critical reevaluation of methodologies in AI development to better align with emerging insights, like those from Bora's Law.
