Taking a little leapfrog from the GPT5 roadmap, Claude 3.7 Sonnet launched today (don't ask about the name - note that there are TWO blogposts and documentation and cookbooks and prompting guides to read, alongside Claude Code which is in limited preview), after numerous leaks from private previews, as one model with an optional thinking mode, with an explicit token budget.

3.7 Sonnet does well on many coding benchmarks like SWE-Bench Verified and aider and Cognition's junior-dev eval, both with and without (MOSTLY uncensored!) thinking.

However the most popular new benchmark, covered in the second blogpost on extended thinking, is Pokebench which mirrors the Voyager paper as an agentic benchmark:

The feature set and documentation at launch is pretty impressive. Among the notable things likely to get buried by the headlines:

* the new system prompt
* redacted thinking encoding/decoding
* streaming thinking
* 128k OUTPUT token capability (in beta)
* context window and prompt caching skips previous turn thinking blocks)
* tool use
* agreeing with Grok 3 that parallel test time compute is useful and worth studying

* Benchmarks are a lie, and I have some examples (Score: 149, Comments: 84): The author criticizes AI benchmark scores, highlighting discrepancies between benchmark results and actual model performance. They cite examples like Midnight Miqu 1.5 and Wingless_Imp_8B, where the latter scored higher but performed worse, and the case of Phi-Lthy and Phi-Line_14B, where a lobotomized model scored better despite reduced layers. They argue that benchmarks may not accurately reflect model capabilities, suggesting that some state-of-the-art models might be overlooked due to misleading scores. Links to the models discussed are provided for further examination: Phi-Line_14B and Phi-lthy4.
EQbench and Benchmark Limitations: EQbench is criticized for using Claude as a judge and favoring "slop and purple prose." The benchmarks are seen as flawed and not reflective of real-world performance, as personal testing often yields different results (ASS Benchmark).
Benchmarks vs. Real-World Performance: Several commenters argue that benchmarks are often gamed and do not accurately represent a model's capabilities in actual use cases. Models like Phi-4 14B are noted to perform better in benchmarks than in practical applications, and users suggest keeping personalized benchmark suites to better evaluate model performance.
Model Performance and User Feedback: Users express that real-world testing and personal experience are more valuable than benchmark scores, as seen with models like Phi-Lthy 14b and Gemini. There is a call for more relevant benchmarks tailored to specific use cases, such as roleplay, which current benchmarks do not adequately cover.
