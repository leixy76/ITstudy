## /r/LocalLlama Recap
Theme 1. Criticism of 'Gotcha' tests to determine LLM intelligence

* Llama goes off the rails if you ask it for 5 odd numbers that don’t have the letter E in them (Score: 465, Comments: 198): The post humorously highlights the challenges faced by Llama, an AI model, when tasked with identifying five odd numbers that lack the letter 'E' in their spelling. The AI's response includes incorrect and nonsensical terms like "Sand," "One," "Tud," and "Dug," illustrating the model's difficulty in accurately processing and reasoning through the request.
Commenters discuss the inherent difficulty for AI models to find odd numbers without the letter "E" in their spelling, noting that most odd numbers in English include "E". Despite various attempts, models like Deepseek R1 and O1-Mini confirmed the impossibility of the task, with some models trying to circumvent the problem using numerals or Roman numerals, as seen with Gemini 1.5 pro.
The discussion highlights the failure modes of AI models with this challenge, with models like Groq 2 humorously altering spellings to fit the criteria. This issue is compared to the "strawberry test", emphasizing that the task involves both a spelling and logical challenge, requiring models to recognize the absence of a valid solution.
The conversation includes references to various AI models and platforms, such as Meta's 70B and 405B models, Qwen2.5-Plus, and Pal Chat iOS app, with Deepseek v3 notably evaluating numbers from 1-100 and concluding that none fit the criteria. This underscores the complexity of the task and the models' varied approaches to problem-solving.

* How is Kokoro TTS so good with so few parameters? (Score: 100, Comments: 46): Kokoro TTS achieves impressive results with only 82M parameters by incorporating modifications to the StyleTTS 2 model architecture and training primarily on synthetic data from OpenAI and ElevenLabs. The effectiveness may stem from either the quality of the synthetic data or undisclosed architectural changes. Kokoro TTS on Hugging Face.
Discussions highlight skepticism about the quality of open source audio datasets and suggest that Kokoro TTS could achieve similar results with fewer parameters. Users express interest in seeing the modified training code to explore pretraining models on consumer hardware, emphasizing the potential to achieve more with less.
The voice cloning feature of Kokoro TTS is debated, with some users noting its absence due to limited training time, while others point out successful voice restoration with minimal audio samples. The restoration of Sky's voice, which was removed by OpenAI, exemplifies this capability using only 3 minutes of audio.
Quantization techniques in TTS models are discussed, with users noting the potential for Kokoro TTS to maintain performance with reduced parameters through methods like FP16 and Int8 quantization. The trade-off between model size and performance is considered, with some suggesting further compression could compromise utility.

Theme 3. Sky-T1: Open-Source AI Model Training for $450

* Researchers open source Sky-T1, a 'reasoning' AI model that can be trained for less than $450 (Score: 52, Comments: 12): Researchers have released Sky-T1, an open-source AI model focused on reasoning capabilities, which can be trained for under $450. This development highlights the trend towards more accessible and cost-effective AI training solutions.
Sky-T1's Training Process: Discussion highlights that Sky-T1 was fine-tuned on QWEN-32B-Instruct using distilled data from QwQ, rather than being trained from scratch for $450. This clarification indicates a misunderstanding in the article regarding the training cost.
Dataset and Reasoning: 17k tasks were used as a dataset, which some find surprisingly small given the potential to easily gather more data from math textbooks. This raises questions about the novelty and effectiveness of the dataset used for training.
Distillation and Thinking Steps: The model's ability to perform reasoning tasks through completion-based distillation is notable, sparking curiosity about why OpenAI doesn't provide explicit thinking steps in their models. There's a mention that even Gemini thinking models don't offer these steps, except for an experimental version.

* Hugging Face released a free course on agents. (Score: 289, Comments: 18): Hugging Face has released a new chapter in its Smolagents course, focusing on three types of agents: code agents, retrieval agents, and custom functional agents. The course is available for free and aims to assist developers in building agent applications, accessible here.
Smolagents and Model Compatibility: Users report issues with the Hugging Face demo code when using qwen2.5-coder 32B with ollama, suggesting potential problems with the default ollama system prompt or endpoint configuration. There is also a discussion about the flexibility of loading different models, including HfApiModel and the possibility of using gguf for VRAM-limited scenarios.
Guidelines on LLM Calls: The guideline to "reduce LLM calls whenever possible" is debated, with some users arguing that in complex agentic workflows involving tasks like search and classification, frequent short LLM calls can be more effective. This approach, while potentially costly, may be necessary for achieving higher precision in professional use cases.
Course Prerequisites and Code Usability: The course is deemed accessible with basic Python knowledge and understanding of LLMs via APIs. There is feedback on the course materials, with a specific note that some code snippets were initially not runnable, which has been addressed in updates to the documentation.
