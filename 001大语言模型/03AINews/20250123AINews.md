Reasoning Distillation is all you need.
> AI News for 1/21/2025-1/22/2025. We checked 7 subreddits, 433 Twitters and 34 Discords (225 channels, and 4297 messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): 496 minutes. You can now tag @smol_ai for AINews discussions!
In the ChatGPT heyday of 2022-23, Alpaca and Vicuna were born out of LMsys and Stanford as ultra cheap ($300) finetunes of LLaMA 1 that distilled from ChatGPT/Bard samples to achieve 90% of the quality of ChatGPT/GPT3.5.
In the last 48 hours, it seems the Berkeley/USC folks have done it again, this time with the reasoning models.
It's hard to believe this sequence of events happened just in the last 2 weeks:
1. Berkeley's Sky Computing lab released Sky-T1-32B-Preview, a finetune of Qwen 2.5 32B (our coverage here) with 17k rows of training data from QwQ-32B (our coverage here) + rewriting traces with gpt-4o-mini + rejection sampling, all done for $450. Because QwQ outperforms o1-preview, distilling from QwQ brings Qwen up to match o1-preview's benchmarks:
2. DeepSeek releases R1 (2 days ago) with benchmarks far above o1-preview. The R1 paper also revealed the surprise that you can distill from R1 to turn a 1.5B Qwen model to match 4o and 3.5 Sonnet (?!).
3. Bespoke Labs (today) uses the Sky-T1 recipe to distill R1 on Qwen again to greatly outperform (not just match) o1-preview, again with 17k rows of reasoning traces.
While Bespoke's distillation does not quite match DeepSeek's distillation in performance, they used 17k samples vs DeepSeek's 800k. It is pretty evident that they could keep going here if they wished.
The bigger shocking thing is that "SFT is all you need" - no major architecture changes are required for reasoning to happen, just feed in more (validated, rephrased) reasoning traces, backtracking and pivoting and all, and it seems like it will generalize well. In all likelihood, this explains the relative efficiency of o1-mini and o3-mini vs their full size counterparts.

> Model Quantization, Fine-tuning Models, DeepSeek R1 Model Support, Chat Templates and Thinking Tags, Dynamic 4-bit Quantization

* Discussion on Model Quantization Techniques: Users debated the effectiveness of various quantization methods, with 8-bit quantization noted for its trade-off between performance and accuracy, while BnB 4-bit was discussed for its dynamic quantization capabilities.

It was pointed out that while BnB 8-bit isn't well supported, alternative methods like FP8 and Q8_0 offer better flexibility and performance.
Fine-tuning with Unsloth: A user inquired about fine-tuning the unsloth models with chat data, expressing that the model should ideally generate sequential messages rather than single responses.

Suggestions included ensuring high-quality dataset examples and considering the employment of another model to supervise and review the outputs.
DeepSeek R1 Compatibility: Clarifications about using the DeepSeek R1 model with llama-server revealed that users need to ensure they load the complete model rather than just a part of it for successful deployment.

Discussion also indicated a broader support for running the model via VLLM, including large versions.
Chat Templates and 'Thinking' Tags: Users explored the lack of a unified 'thinking' tag in chat templates for behavior training in DeepSeek, noting the resultant COT aspect in responses.

Suggestions were made to either incorporate such templating or to avoid using specific templates entirely during training.
Introduction of Dynamic 4-bit Quantization: The unsloth-bnb quantization method was introduced as a dynamic approach that aims to maintain accuracy while significantly reducing model size.

It was emphasized that this method only slightly increases VRAM usage while effectively optimizing model performance.

* TMA Implementation Crashes with Autotune: Users reported that managing autotuning manually via config pruning fails with the current TMA implementation, causing crashes when using @triton.autotune with multiple configs.

One user highlighted that the autotuner does not work with TMA and that manual configuration is the only way forward.
Persistent Matmul Descriptor Confusion: There are discrepancies in the usage of descriptors, specifically noting that the device version uses tl._experimental_make_tensor_descriptor, which isn't available in the latest version.

A user shared a workaround that involves creating descriptors via torch instead of numpy to avoid errors in Triton 3.2.
TRITON_INTERPRET Alters Kernel Execution: A user faced issues with the execution order in their Triton kernel due to data dependencies, stating that using tl.debug_barrier doesn’t resolve the execution order change by the compiler.

They noticed the correct result occurs only when TRITON_INTERPRET=1, emphasizing the potential datatype changes affecting the execution.
Order of Operations Affects Results: Discussion arose regarding the improper execution order of operations in a kernel, where parts of code meant to execute sequentially were altered in the generated PTX code.

The crack in execution was linked to the fact that the kernel produced wrong results when not interpreting properly, raising concerns about how the compiler optimizes code.
Call for Collaboration on Hard GPU Papers: A user expressed interest in pooling resources and expertise to implement interesting and challenging GPU-related papers together.

This initiative aims to bring members together for collaborative development efforts in understanding complex GPU algorithms.
