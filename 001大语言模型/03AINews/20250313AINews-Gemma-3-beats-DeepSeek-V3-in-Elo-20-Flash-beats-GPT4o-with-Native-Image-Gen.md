Today's o1-preview (at this point the only model competitive with Flash Thinking at AINews tasks, and yes o1-preview is better than o1-full or o3-mini-high) Discord recap is spot on - Google took the occasion of their Gemma Developer Day in Paris to launch a slew of notable updates:

Gemma 3. People are loving that it is 128k context. Other than of course strong LMArena scores for an open model:

it is also a new Pareto frontier for its weight class by a country mile:

It also looks to completely subsume PaliGemma in incorporating vision as a first class capability (ShieldGemma is still a thing).
Gemini Flash Native Image Generation.
as teased at the Gemini 2 launch (our coverage here), Gemini 2 actually launched image editing, which OpenAI teased and never launched, and the results are pretty spectacular (if you can figure out how to find it in the complicated UI). Image editing has never been this easy.
