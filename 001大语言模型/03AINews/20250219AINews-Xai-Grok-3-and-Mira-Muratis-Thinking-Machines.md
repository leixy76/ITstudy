It is a rare day when one frontier lab makes its debut, much less two (loosely speaking). But that is almost certainly what happened today.
We would say that the full Grok 3 launch stream is worth watching at 2x:
Opinions on Grok 3 are mixed, with lmarena, karpathy, and information recycler threadbois mostly very positive, whereas /r/OpenAI and other independent evals being more skeptical. Not everything is released either; Grok 3 isn't available in API and as of time of writing, the demoed "Think" and "Big Brain" modes aren't live yet. On the whole the evidence points to Grok 3 laying credible claim to being somewhere between o1 and o3, and this undeniable trajectory is why we award it title story.

There is less "news you can use" in the second item, but Mira Murati's post OpenAI plan is now finally public, and she has assembled what is almost certainly going to be a serious frontier lab in Thinking Machines, recruiting notables from across the frontier labs and specifically ChatGPT alumni:

There's not a lot of detail in the manifesto beyond a belief in publishing research, emphasis on collaborative and personalizable AI, multimodality, research and product co-design, and an empirical approach to safety and alignment. On paper, it looks like "Anthropic Redux".

AI Industry and Market Analysis

* xAI as a SOTA Competitor: @scaling01 argued that after Grok-3, xAI must be considered a real competitor for SOTA models, though OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google might be internally ahead. @ArtificialAnlys also stated xAI has arrived at the frontier and joined the 'Big 5' American AI labs. @omarsar0 noted Elon mentioned Grok 3 is an order of magnitude more capable than Grok 2. @arankomatsuzaki observed China's rapid AI progress with DeepSeek and Qwen, highlighting the maturation of the Chinese AI community.
* OpenAI's Strategy and Market Position: @scaling01 discussed Gemini 2.0 Flash cutting into Anthropic's market share, suggesting Anthropic needs to lower prices or release a better model to maintain growth. @scaling01 commented that Grok-3 launch might be for mind-share and attention, as GPT-4.5 and a new Anthropic model are coming soon and Grok-3's top spot might be short-lived.
* Perplexity's Growth and Deep Research: @AravSrinivas highlighted the growing number of daily PDF exports from Perplexity Deep Research, indicating increasing usage. @AravSrinivas shared survey data showing over 52% of users would switch from Gemini to Perplexity.

# AI Reddit Recap
## /r/LocalLlama Recap
Theme 1. OpenAI's O3-Mini vs Phone-Sized Model Poll Controversy

* Sam Altman's poll on open sourcing a model.. (Score: 631, Comments: 214): Sam Altman conducted a Twitter poll asking whether it would be more useful to create a small "o3-mini" level model or the best "phone-sized model" for their next open source project, with the latter option receiving 62.2% of the 695 total votes so far. The poll has 23 hours remaining for participation, indicating community engagement in decision-making about open-sourcing AI models.
Many commenters advocate for the o3-mini model, arguing that it can be distilled into a mobile phone model if needed, and emphasizing its potential utility on local machines and for small organizations. Some express skepticism about the poll's integrity, suggesting that it might be a marketing strategy or that the poll results are manipulated.
There is a strong sentiment against the phone-sized model, with users questioning its practicality given current hardware limitations and suggesting that larger models can be more versatile. Some believe that OpenAI might eventually release both models, using the poll to decide which to release first.
The discussion reflects a broader skepticism about OpenAI's open-source intentions, with some users doubting the company's commitment to open-sourcing their models. Others highlight the importance of distillation techniques to create smaller, efficient models from larger ones, suggesting that this approach could be beneficial for the open-source community.

* ClosedAI Next Open Source (Score: 119, Comments: 27): Sam Altman sparked a debate with a tweet asking whether it is more advantageous to develop a smaller model for GPU use or to focus on creating the best possible phone-sized model. The discussion centers on the trade-offs between model size and operational efficiency across different platforms.
Local Phone Models face criticism for being slow, consuming significant battery, and taking up disk space, compared to online models. Commenters express skepticism about the practicality of a local phone model and suggest that votes for such models may be influenced by OpenAI employees.
OpenAI's Business Model is scrutinized, with doubts about their willingness to open-source models like o3. Users speculate that OpenAI might only release models when they become obsolete and express concern about potential regulatory impacts on genuinely open-source companies.
There is a strong push for supporting O3-MINI as a more versatile option, with the potential for distillation into a mobile version. Some users criticize the framing of the poll and predict that OpenAI might release a suboptimal model to appear open-source without genuinely supporting open innovation.

Theme 2. GROK-3 Claims SOTA Supremacy Amid GPU Controversy

* GROK-3 (SOTA) and GROK-3 mini both top O3-mini high and Deepseek R1 (Score: 334, Comments: 312): Grok-3 Beta achieves a leading score of 96 in Math (AIME '24), showcasing its superior performance compared to competitors like O3-mini (high) and Deepseek-R1. The bar graph highlights the comparative scores across categories of Math, Science (GPQA), and Coding (LCB Oct-Feb), with Grok-3 models outperforming other models in the test-time compute analysis.
Many users express skepticism about Grok-3's performance claims, noting the lack of independent benchmarks and the absence of open-source availability. Lmsys is mentioned as an independent benchmark, but users are wary of the $40/month cost without significant differentiators from other models like ChatGPT.
Discussions highlight concerns about Elon Musk's involvement with Grok-3, with users expressing distrust and associating his actions with fascist ideologies. Some comments critique the use of the term "woke" in the context of open-source discussions and highlight the controversy surrounding Musk's political activities.
Technical discussions focus on the ARC-AGI benchmark, which is costly and complex to test, with OpenAI having invested significantly in it. Users note that Grok-3 was not tested on ARC-AGI, and there's interest in seeing its performance on benchmarks where current SOTA models struggle.
