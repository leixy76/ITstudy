We saw this on Friday but gave it time for peer review, and it is positive enough to give it a headline story (PRIME blogpost):

Ever since Let's Verify Step By Step established the importance of process reward models, the hunt has been on for an "open source" version of this. PRIME deals with some of the unique challenges of online RL:

and trains it up on a 7B model for incredibly impressive results vs 4o:

## /r/LocalLlama Recap
Theme 1. DeepSeek V3's Dominance in AI Workflows

* DeepSeek V3 is the shit. (Score: 524, Comments: 207): DeepSeek V3 impresses with its 600 billion parameters, providing reliability and versatility that previous models, including Claude, ChatGPT, and earlier Gemini variants, lacked. The model excels in generating detailed responses and adapting to user prompts, making it a preferred choice for professionals frustrated by inconsistent workflows with state-of-the-art models.
Users compare DeepSeek V3 to Claude 3.5 Sonnet, noting its coding capabilities but expressing frustration with its slow response times for long contexts. Some users face issues with the API when using tools like Cline or OpenRouter, while others appreciate its stability in the chat web interface.
Discussions highlight the deployment challenges of DeepSeek V3, particularly the need for GPU server clusters, making it less accessible for individual users. There is a suggestion that investing in Intel GPUs could have been a strategic move to encourage development of more specified code.
AMD's mi300x and mi355x products are mentioned in relation to AI development, with mi300x being a fast-selling product despite not being initially designed for AI. The upcoming Strix Halo APU is noted as a significant development for high-end consumer markets, indicating AMD's growing presence in the AI hardware space.

* DeepSeek v3 running at 17 tps on 2x M2 Ultra with MLX.distributed! (Score: 105, Comments: 30): DeepSeek v3 reportedly achieves 17 transactions per second (TPS) on a setup with 2x M2 Ultra processors using MLX.distributed technology. The information was shared by a user on Twitter, with a link provided for further details here.
Discussions highlighted the cost and performance comparison between M2 Ultra processors and used 3090 GPUs, noting that while 3090 GPUs offer higher performance by an order of magnitude, they are significantly less power-efficient. MoffKalast calculated that for the price of $7,499.99, one could power a 3090 GPU for about a decade at full load, considering electricity costs at 20 cents per kWh.
Context length and token generation were important technical considerations, with users questioning how the number of tokens impacts TPS and whether the 4096-token prompt affects performance. Coder543 referenced a related discussion on Reddit regarding performance differences with various prompt lengths.
The MOE (Mixture of Experts) model's efficiency was debated, with fallingdowndizzyvr pointing out that all experts need to be loaded since their usage cannot be predicted beforehand, impacting resource allocation and performance.

Discussions around Dolphin 3.0 highlight concerns about model performance and benchmarks, with users noting the absence of comprehensive benchmarks making it difficult to assess the model's quality. A user shared a quick test result showing Dolphin 3.0 scoring 37.80 on the MMLU-Pro dataset, compared to Llama 3.1 scoring 47.56, but cautioned that these results are preliminary.
The distinction between Dolphin and Abliterated models was clarified, with Abliterated models having their refusal vectors removed, whereas Dolphin models are fine-tuned on new datasets. Some users find Abliterated models more reliable, while Dolphin models are described as "edgy" rather than truly "uncensored."
There is anticipation for future updates, with Dolphin 3.1 expected to reduce the frequency of disclaimers. Larger models, such as 32b and 72b, are currently in training, as confirmed by Discord announcements, with efforts to improve model behavior by flagging and removing disclaimers.

* I made a (difficult) humour analysis benchmark about understanding the jokes in cult British pop quiz show Never Mind the Buzzcocks (Score: 108, Comments: 34): The post discusses a humor analysis benchmark called "BuzzBench" for evaluating emotional intelligence in language models (LLMs) using the cult British quiz show "Never Mind the Buzzcocks". The benchmark ranks models by their humor understanding scores, with "claude-3.5-sonnet" scoring the highest at 61.94 and "llama-3.2-1b-instruct" the lowest at 9.51.
Cultural Bias Concerns: Commenters express concerns about potential cultural bias in humor analysis, particularly due to the British context of "Never Mind the Buzzcocks". Questions arise about how such biases are addressed, such as whether British spelling or audience is explicitly stated.
Benchmark Details: The benchmark, BuzzBench, evaluates models on understanding and predicting humor impact, with a maximum score of 100. The current state-of-the-art score is 61.94, and the dataset is available on Hugging Face.
Interest in Historical Context: There is curiosity about how models would perform with older episodes of the quiz show, questioning whether familiarity with less popular hosts like Simon Amstell impacts humor understanding.

Theme 3. RTX 5090 Rumors: High Bandwidth Potential

* RTX 5090 rumored to have 1.8 TB/s memory bandwidth (Score: 141, Comments: 161): The RTX 5090 is rumored to have 1.8 TB/s memory bandwidth and a 512-bit memory bus, surpassing all professional cards except the A100/H100 with their 2 TB/s bandwidth and 5120-bit bus. Despite its 32GB GDDR7 VRAM, the RTX 5090 could potentially be the fastest for running any LLM <30B at Q6.
Discussions highlight the lack of sufficient VRAM in NVIDIA's consumer GPUs, with criticisms that a mere 8GB increase over two generations is inadequate for AI and gaming needs. Users express frustration that NVIDIA intentionally limits VRAM to protect their professional card market, suggesting that a 48GB or 64GB model would cannibalize their high-end offerings.
Cost concerns are prevalent, with users noting that the price of a single RTX 5090 could equate to multiple RTX 3090s, which still hold significant value due to their VRAM and performance. The price per GB of VRAM for consumer cards is seen as more favorable compared to professional GPUs, but the overall cost remains prohibitive for many.
Energy efficiency and power draw are critical considerations, as the RTX 5090 is rumored to have a significant power requirement of at least 550 watts, compared to the 3090's 350 watts. Users discuss undervolting as a potential solution, but emphasize that the trade-off between speed, VRAM, and power consumption remains a key factor in GPU selection.

* LLMs which fit into 24Gb (Score: 53, Comments: 32): The author has built a rig with an i7-12700kf CPU, 128Gb RAM, and an RTX 3090 24 GB, highlighting that models fitting into VRAM run significantly faster. They mention achieving good results with Gemma2 27B for generic discussions and Qwen2.5-coder 31B for programming tasks, and inquire about other models suitable for a 24Gb VRAM limit.
Model Recommendations: Users suggest various models suitable for a 24GB VRAM setup, including Llama-3_1-Nemotron-51B-instruct and Mistral small. Quantized Q4 models like QwQ 32b and Llama 3.1 Nemotron 51b are highlighted for their efficiency and performance in this setup.
Performance Metrics: Commenters discuss the throughput of different models, with Qwen2.5 32B achieving 40-60 tokens/s on a 3090 and potentially higher on a 4090. 72B Q4 models can run at around 2.5 tokens/s with partial offloading, while 32B Q4 models achieve 20-38 tokens/s.
Software and Setup: There is interest in the software setups used to achieve these performance metrics, with requests for details on setups using EXL2, tabbyAPI, and context lengths. A link to a Reddit discussion provides further resources for model selection on single GPU setups.
