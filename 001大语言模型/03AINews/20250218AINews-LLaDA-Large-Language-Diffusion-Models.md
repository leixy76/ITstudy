There was something today for everyone.
Ahead of the expected Grok 3 release late tonight on a US holiday, today was a notable day of small things. Either:

* the big model releases of the day were the two StepFun models, Step-Video-T2V (30B Text to Video with remarkable coherence, including the famously hard ballerinas that Sora gets wrong) and Step-Audio-Chat, a 132B voice to voice model
* or you could look at Scale AI's EnigmaEval (very hard multimodal puzzles) or Cambridge's ZeroBench (100 manually-curated multi-step visual reasoning questions) evals where current frontier models score 0.
* or you could look at Schulman and Zoph's latest talk on post-training.

But we choose to award today's title story to LLaDA: Large Language Diffusion Models, the first text diffusion model scaled up to be competitive with autoregressive models like Llama 3 8B.

This is a "white whale" alternative LLM architecture that has only been speculated about but never successfully scaled up til now. The main trick is adapting diffusion to predict uniformly masked tokens, producing text in a diffusion process:

For those used to text streaming in from left to right, diffusion doesn't seem very practical... until you try to infill between preset text structures and word choices that you desire, or create coherent long form story structures. LLaDA could be the start of something much bigger here.
