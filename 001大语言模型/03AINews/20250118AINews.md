## /r/LocalLlama Recap
Theme 1. ElevenLabs' TTS: Factors Behind Outstanding Quality

* What is ElevenLabs doing? How is it so good? (Score: 320, Comments: 130): ElevenLabs' text-to-speech (TTS) technology is notably superior compared to local models, raising questions about whether it uses a full Transformer model or a Diffuser. The post speculates on whether the company models human anatomy to enhance model accuracy.
The consensus among commenters is that high-quality data is crucial for achieving superior text-to-speech (TTS) performance, with ElevenLabs leveraging actual audiobook data to outperform competitors. Kokoro TTS is mentioned as an open-source alternative but is noted to fall short in emotional expression compared to ElevenLabs.
Several comments highlight that ElevenLabs' success is attributed to using a relatively small compute setup (32x3090 GPUs) and focusing on high-quality datasets rather than synthetic data. Some speculate that ElevenLabs could be built on Tortoise with proprietary optimizations, emphasizing the importance of finetuning with quality voice samples.
Discussions also touch on the challenges of acquiring high-quality, licensed audiobook datasets due to cost and legal issues, with suggestions that Mozilla could play a role in commissioning professional voice actors for training datasets. The public domain resource LibriVox is noted as a potential source for such data.
