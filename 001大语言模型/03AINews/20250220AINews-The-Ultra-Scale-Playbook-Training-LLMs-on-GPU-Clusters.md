[The Ultra-Scale Playbook - a Hugging Face Space by nanotron](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nanotron/ultrascale-playbook)

This is a great starting point for people looking for intuitive, detailed understanding of modern training constraints and strategies to scale things up on GPUs, with a first-principles build up of modern best practices:

对于那些希望直观、详细地了解现代训练约束以及在 GPU 上扩展训练规模的策略的人来说，这是一个很好的起点。本文档以第一性原理为基础，逐步构建了现代最佳实践：

and not to mention the blogpost is interactive, based on real data backed by 4000 scaling experiments on up to 512 GPUs.
Not strictly required for AI Engineers, but a fantastic starting point for anyone looking to get up to speed on training terminology.

更值得一提的是，这篇博文是交互式的，它基于真实的实验数据，这些数据来源于在多达 512 个 GPU 上进行的 4000 次扩展实验。AI 工程师可以不必阅读，但对于任何想要快速掌握训练相关术语的人来说，这绝对是一个非常好的开始。

Theme 1. o3-mini Replaces DeepSeek as This Year's LLaMA Front-runner

* o3-mini won the poll! We did it guys! (Score: 1688, Comments: 186): o3-mini won a Twitter poll with 54% of the 128,108 votes, beating the "phone-sized model" option. A reply from Ahmad suggests the poll was misleading and encourages votes for "o3-mini," highlighting community engagement with likes, quotes, and reposts.
Model Distillation Discussion: Users discussed the process of distilling a model, which involves creating a smaller, faster version by training a compact model (student) to mimic a larger model (teacher). Techniques such as knowledge distillation, pruning, and quantization are used, but OpenAI's closed-source nature limits direct distillation from their models.
Skepticism on Model Releases: There is skepticism about whether OpenAI will release an open-source model, as historically they've moved away from open models. Users are wary of terms like "o3-mini level," suggesting it might not meet expectations or be a significantly downgraded version.
Community Reactions and Sarcasm: The community expressed mixed feelings about the Twitter poll results and the potential release of a "phone-sized" model. Comments highlighted the use of sarcasm and skepticism regarding the actual utility and performance of such models, with some users humorously noting the potential for underwhelming releases.

主题 1. DeepSeek GPU 走私案：调查 Nvidia 在新加坡的异常收入

* DeepSeek GPU smuggling probe shows Nvidia's Singapore GPU sales are 28% of its revenue, but only 1% are delivered to the country: Report (Score: 286, Comments: 90): DeepSeek's investigation reveals that Nvidia's GPU sales in Singapore account for 28% of its revenue, yet only 1% of these GPUs are actually delivered to the country. This discrepancy suggests possible GPU smuggling activities.
The DeepSeek V3 paper was questioned for its claim of using 8-bit floating point (FP8), which would be a significant shift in AI model training if true. Discussions reveal skepticism about the authenticity of DeepSeek's claims, with some suggesting it was overhyped by media outlets.
Singapore's role as a major trading port was highlighted, explaining the high percentage of Nvidia's revenue attributed to the country despite low actual delivery. This aligns with Singapore's trade-to-GDP ratio of over 300%, suggesting potential re-exporting or processing activities rather than direct smuggling.
Nvidia's actions are perceived as attempts to circumvent US laws, with some commenters noting the misleading nature of article titles and the strategic importance of GPUs. The discussion touches on broader geopolitical implications, including comparisons to China's potential control over strategic assets.

* ChatGPT Founder Shares The Anatomy Of The Perfect Prompt Template (Score: 1232, Comments: 62): Greg Brockman shared a tweet detailing the structure of an optimal prompt for ChatGPT, focusing on creating unique weekend getaways near New York City. The prompt includes sections such as "Goal," "Return Format," "Warnings," and "Context dump" to ensure clarity and effectiveness in generating responses.
Prompt Structure and Effectiveness: There is a discussion about the effectiveness of prompt structure, with some users noting that placing the goal or question at the top can lead to less desirable responses, while others argue that placing it at the bottom or using data separators improves outcomes. ArthurParkerhouse suggests using a triple hash separator to distinguish between context and tasks, which aligns with MemeMan64209's observation of better results when questions are placed last.
AI Interaction and User Experience: Fit-Buddy-9035 compares prompting AI to communicating with a logical, direct individual, emphasizing the need for clarity and explicitness, while Professional-Noise80 highlights that crafting effective prompts requires critical thinking. TheSaltySeagull87 notes that the effort in creating detailed prompts can be comparable to traditional research methods like using Google or Reddit.
Cognitive Processing in AI Models: MaintenanceOk3364 suggests that AI models, like humans, prioritize initial information, but MemeMan64209 and ArthurParkerhouse observe that AI might prioritize the last tokens read, reflecting a discrepancy in perception of how AI processes information. This highlights the complexity and variability in AI's cognitive processing, sparking further debate on optimal prompt design.

* ChatGPT 创始人分享完美 Prompt 模板的详解（得分：1232，评论：62)：Greg Brockman 在推特上分享了一个关于 ChatGPT 最佳 Prompt 结构的帖子，重点在于创建纽约市周边地区的独特周末度假方案。该 Prompt 包括「目标（Goal）」、「返回格式（Return Format）」、「警告（Warnings）」和「上下文转储（Context dump）」等部分，以确保生成回复的清晰度和有效性。为了实现这一点，结构化的 Prompt 至关重要。

Prompt 结构和有效性： 有用户讨论了 Prompt 结构的有效性，一些用户指出，将目标或问题放在 Prompt 的开头可能会导致不太理想的回复，而另一些用户则认为，将目标或问题放在 Prompt 的末尾，或者使用数据分隔符则可以改善结果。ArthurParkerhouse 建议使用三重哈希分隔符来区分上下文和任务，这与 MemeMan64209 观察到的将问题放在最后会获得更好结果的观点一致。

AI 交互和用户体验： Fit-Buddy-9035 将使用 Prompt 与 AI 交互比作与一个逻辑清晰、非常直接的人交流，强调需要清晰和明确地表达意图。Professional-Noise80 则强调，设计有效的 Prompt 需要批判性思维。TheSaltySeagull87 指出，创建详细 Prompt 所需的精力，与使用 Google 或 Reddit 等传统研究方法相当。

AI 模型中的认知处理： MaintenanceOk3364 认为，AI 模型与人类类似，会优先处理初始信息，但 MemeMan64209 和 ArthurParkerhouse 观察到，AI 可能会优先考虑最后读取的 Token，这反映了对 AI 如何处理信息的认知存在差异。这突显了 AI 认知处理的复杂性和可变性，引发了关于最佳 Prompt 设计的进一步讨论。

### DSPy ▷ #papers (3 messages):
> Self-Supervised Prompt Optimization, Retrieval Augmented Generation, Real-time Information Integration, LLM Performance Improvement

* Self-Supervised Prompt Optimization framework introduced: A new approach called Self-Supervised Prompt Optimization (SPO) aims to discover effective prompts for both closed and open-ended tasks without external references, making it cost-efficient. The framework derives evaluation signals purely from output comparisons, enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.
One participant noted it was crazy for the paper to not mention DSPy until the last paragraph.
* One participant noted it was crazy for the paper to not mention DSPy until the last paragraph.
* Dynamic content integration through Retrieval Augmented Generation: The study proposes an alternative to traditional retrieval methods by using standard search engine APIs to dynamically integrate the latest online information during generative inference. This approach aims to improve generated content quality without relying on a fixed index.
The new paradigm involves a parser-LLM that determines the need for Internet augmentation and extracts search keywords in a single inference.

> Model Testing, Performance Comparison, Computational Complexity

* Mixed experiences with model performance: One user shared that testing on a 10-year-old GeForce 850M in Windows 10 yielded 3 tok/s initially but gradually decreased, while Chrome took 2 minutes to load with only 0.2 tok/s.
In contrast, another reported using an RTX 4070 on Windows 11, achieving a much faster rate of 12 tok/s with a 1.9 seconds time to first token.
