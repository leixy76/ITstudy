This initiative could significantly enhance accessibility for developers and researchers, potentially transforming local computational capabilities.
The community questions the democratization claims of NVIDIA's Project Digits, suggesting it primarily democratizes deployment rather than training. Some users argue that true democratization would require open-sourcing CUDA and note that NVIDIA's benchmarks use fp4 precision, which is lower than typical standards like fp32 or fp16.
There is skepticism about the supercomputer label, with comparisons to existing GPU and RAM bandwidth standards suggesting that the Digits offering may not match expectations. Users highlight that competitive products with higher RAM bandwidths and wider RAM to CPU buses already exist, such as Apple's M4 Max with 546 GB/s and AMD EPYC with 460 GB/s.
Discussions also focus on the role of CUDA in machine learning, with some advocating for more vendor-agnostic solutions like Triton. While CUDA is still prevalent for developing new ML techniques, there is a push towards frameworks that support multiple vendors, as seen with OpenAI and Triton, which is gaining traction for its ease of use and performance.
