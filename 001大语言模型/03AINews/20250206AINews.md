Gemini 2.0 has been "here" since December (our coverage here), but now we can officially count Gemini 2.0 Flash's prices as "real", and put them up on our Pareto frontier chart:

We will grant that raw intelligence charts like those mean increasingly less and will probably die this year because they cannot accurately describe the multimodal input AND output capabilities of these releases, nor coding ability, nor the 1-2m long context, as Sundar Pichai demonstrates:

Of particular note is the cost effectiveness of the new "Flash Lite", as well as the very slight price hike that Gemini 2.0 Flash has vs 1.5 Flash.
Curiously enough, the competitive dynamics of OpenAI "mogging" Google releases seem to have stayed in 2024.

Theme 1. DeepSeek VL2 Small Launch and R1's Benchmark Success

* DeepSeek just released an official demo for DeepSeek VL2 Small - It's really powerful at OCR, text extraction and chat use-cases (Hugging Face Space) (Score: 615, Comments: 37): The DeepSeek VL2 Small demo, a 16B MoE model, has been released on Hugging Face, showcasing its capabilities in OCR, text extraction, and chat applications. Vaibhav Srivastav and Zizheng Pan announced the release on X, highlighting its utility in various vision-language tasks.
Release Timeline & Performance: The DeepSeek VL2 Small model was uploaded to Hugging Face about two months ago, and there is anticipation for a reasoning model to be released this month. Commenters note the model's good performance for its size, though some prefer florence-2-large-ft for specific visual tasks.
Accessibility & Integration: Discussion includes the utility of vision-language models in navigating websites, especially when accessibility is well-implemented. Users are advised to try the model on a few documents before integrating it into their systems.
Model Availability & Tools: There is interest in the DeepSeek V3 Lite and the gguf format, with a suggestion to use convert_hf_to_gguf.py from llama.cpp for conversion. The demo link provided by Environmental-Metal9 is here, though some report the demo is not currently working.

* 2B model beats 72B model (Score: 164, Comments: 57): The DeepSeek R1-V project demonstrates that a 2B-parameter model can outperform a 72B-parameter model in vision language tasks, achieving superior effectiveness and out-of-distribution robustness. The model achieved 99% and 81% accuracy in specific out-of-distribution evaluations using only 100 training steps, costing $2.62 and running for 30 minutes on 8 A100 GPUs. The project is fully open-sourced and available here.
Some commenters express skepticism about the DeepSeek R1-V model's achievements, suggesting that the results might be misleading or overly specific to certain benchmarks. Admirable-Star7088 and Everlier humorously highlight that smaller models can outperform larger ones in niche tasks but emphasize that larger models are generally more versatile.
Real-Technician831 and iam_wizard discuss the practical implications of using smaller models for specific tasks, noting that this approach can be more compute-efficient for business applications with narrow scopes. They argue that such results should not be surprising, as fine-tuning smaller models for specific tasks is a known strategy.
The discussion includes a reference to another model, phi-CTNL, which reportedly beats larger models across various benchmarks, as shared by gentlecucumber with a link to arXiv. This adds to the conversation about benchmark-specific performance versus general-purpose capabilities.

* The Sonnet model stands out in discussions for its performance in the lmsys webdev arena, with users noting its superiority over other models despite its smaller size. There's a debate on whether models like Sonnet should be compared to those focused on inference scaling, with some attributing competitive advantages to new methodologies.

Theme 3. Debating Open Source in AI: A Look at DeepSeek and More

* DeepSeek corrects itself regarding their "fully open source" claim (Score: 126, Comments: 36): DeepSeek issued a "Terminology Correction" about their DeepSeek-R1, clarifying that while their code and models are released under the MIT License, they are not "fully open-source" as previously claimed. The tweet announcing this correction has received significant engagement with 186 likes, 39 retweets, and 324 replies, and has been viewed 27,000 times.
Many commenters argue that while the MIT License is often associated with open-source, DeepSeek's claim is misleading because they did not release the source code or training data. This distinction is crucial in determining whether something is truly open-source, as having access to the source code is a fundamental requirement.
coder543 emphasizes that Llama models and similar projects are not fully open-source either, as they lack detailed dataset descriptions and training code. This highlights a broader issue in the AI community where models are released with weights but without sufficient information or resources to replicate the training process.
The discussion highlights a misunderstanding or misuse of the term "open-source" when applied to AI models and software. Some users clarify that licensing under MIT doesn't inherently make something open-source unless the actual source code is provided, illustrating the difference between licensing and actual openness.
