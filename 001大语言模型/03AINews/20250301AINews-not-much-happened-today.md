# AI Twitter Recap
GPT-4.5 Model Performance and User Perception

* Initial User Experiences and Subjective Evaluation: @karpathy conducted a poll comparing GPT-4 and GPT-4.5, finding that in 4 out of 5 questions, users preferred GPT-4, which was surprising as @karpathy personally found GPT-4.5 better in all cases, suggesting a possible preference for "high-taste testers" towards GPT-4.5's deeper charm, creativity, and humor. However, @jeremyphoward responded to Karpathy's poll results, stating that the awkwardness, not "high taste" was the reason for user preference. @Teknium1 also reacted to the poll results with "Damn lol must have some high, or low, taste people testing here idk". @abacaj expressed strong dissatisfaction, stating GPT-4.5 needs to enhance productivity to be useful, otherwise it is "fucking useless". @abacaj also argued that if GPT-4.5 is only a "high taste" model, it is "blowing investor money". @stevenheidel likened the GPT-4.5 launch to the initial ChatGPT excitement, as people are again having fun chatting with AI.
* Concerns Regarding Speed and Practicality: @abacaj noted GPT-4.5 is "very slow" and "impractical to use for agent loops", despite being "fun to prompt". @abacaj elaborated that it takes "3+ minutes to answer one question" in a moderate prompt loop, deeming it "very impractical". @abacaj further commented that GPT-4.5 "feels more like a research artifact than a real model you can deploy" due to its slowness.
* Critique of Capabilities and Value Proposition: @abacaj criticized the showcased capabilities of the "largest language model", questioning if drawing a triangle using SVG is the highlight. @abacaj found the value add for end-users questionable, suggesting internal use within OAI for distillation.
* Pricing and Economic Viability: @Yuchenj_UW remarked that the pricing "makes even less sense" in light of GPT-4.5's performance. @Yuchenj_UW speculated about the potential pricing of GPT-5 and o4. @AravSrinivas highlighted Perplexity Deep Research at $20/month versus ChatGPT at $200/month.
* Performance Compared to Other Models: @METR_Evals reported that GPT-4.5 performs above GPT-4o but below o1 or Claude 3.5 Sonnet based on METR experiments with an earlier checkpoint, noting a time horizon score of ~30 minutes. @dylan522p stated Claude 3.7 beats GPT 4.5 on most tasks, but GPT 4.5 has better "vibes" and is the first model since Claude 3 Opus to make them laugh, emphasizing humor as intelligence. @scaling01 speculated GPT-4.5 could be "GPT-4o x 10" in size, estimating around 5T parameters. @Teknium1 mentioned Grok's context window is only 128k. @multimodalart shared evaluations comparing GPT 4.5 with non-thinking models like Sonnet 3.7, Deepseek V3, and Grok 3.
* Emotional Intelligence (EQ) and "Vibes": @karpathy found Claude 3.7's humor to be the funniest after scrutinizing LLM outputs for humor. @random_walker argued that the "EQ" improvements in GPT 4.5 are due to post-training, not parameter count, suggesting any EQ differences are behavioral rather than capability-based. @random_walker further claimed that GPT-4o and GPT-3.5 can exhibit similar EQ behavior as GPT-4.5 with appropriate post-training. @omarsar0 suggested using the OpenAI Playground to compare models and observe GPT-4.5's "thoughtful" responses. @omarsar0 noted GPT-4.5 often sounds more "thoughtful" by adding sensations and thoughts. @marktenenholtz observed that Sonnet 3.7 is "almost too eager" and GPT-4.5 is "almost too deferential".
* Technical Details and Training: @sama credited @ColinWei11, Yujia Jin, and @MikhailPavlov5 for the difficult work at the intersection of ML and systems required for GPT-4.5. @cloneofsimo highlighted that GPT4.5 was "trained on multiple datacenters" and "aggressively used low precision training", implying "diloco goes brr" and the benefit of fp8 training due to high granularity. @rasbt pointed to the system card mentioning "new supervision techniques" used in training. @rasbt mentioned that apparently character-training was not used. @Teknium1 questioned how GPT-4.5's knowledge cutoff remains 2023 despite current pretraining runs, speculating about data contamination from ChatGPT 3.5 data or if the model was trained long ago.

Model Architecture, Scaling Laws and Efficiency

* Scaling Law Limitations and Alternative Approaches: @Yuchenj_UW suggested that the GPT-4.5 release indicates LLM pre-training scaling has plateaued, noting that a 10x compute increase yields limited improvement, which allows companies like xAI to catch up through innovation in algorithms and data, as demonstrated by DeepSeek's efficiency gains. @jxmnop echoed this, suggesting GPT 4.5 might signal "the beginning of the end for scaling laws", questioning if data is exhausted or if scaling laws fail to capture desired task performance. @ibab emphasized that algorithms are increasingly important with larger models, suspecting training details are key to Grok 3's performance. @MParakhin stated pre-training needs higher-perplexity targeted data and Active Learning to progress further. @teortaxesTex asserted that non-thinking LLMs pretrained on natural data have hit their practical limit, doubting a $1T training run would significantly improve them.
* Inference Compute and Efficiency: @rasbt clarified that train- and inference-compute are orthogonal ways to improve LLMs and an apple-to-oranges comparison is being made without considering inference-compute scaling for GPT-4.5. @rasbt questioned if GPT-4.5 is more expensive and slower than o1 (GPT4-sized + inference-compute scaling) and what GPT-4.5 with o1-style scaling would look like. @iScienceLuvr highlighted research on "Thinking Slow, Fast", using distilled reasoners based on smaller models like Llama-1B and -3B with Mamba architecture to improve inference scaling. @_akhaliq shared FlexiDiT, a diffusion transformer framework that generates high-quality samples with less compute by using varying patch sizes during denoising. @TheTuringPost discussed Chain of Draft (CoD), which encourages models to generate short reasoning steps to reduce costs and speed up models while maintaining accuracy.
* Hardware and System Architecture: @reach_vb highlighted DeepSeek's Fire-Flyer File System (3FS), noting its disaggregated architecture, strong consistency using CRAQ, stateless metadata services, and KVCache for inference, achieving high read throughput and outperforming in benchmarks. @teortaxesTex discussed N4 process allowing 2.32x denser chips compared to N7, based on transistor counts and die sizes. @awnihannun reported Kimi's Moonshot 16B MoE model running nicely on M4 Max with MLX at 154 toks/sec, performing as good or better than dense 7Bs. @casper_hansen_ commented on CUDA's moat, noting even AMD engineers use CUDA for tensor engines.

> GPT-4.5 performance, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Cursor bugs, Windsurf vs Cursor, Memory bank usefulness

* GPT-4.5 Disappoints with Hefty Price Tag: Early testers find GPT-4.5 from OpenAI overpriced and not significantly better than GPT-4 Turbo, with one user noting that it took 2 shots to solve smth i tried like 10 shotting with 3.7 yesterday and the cost at $150 per million tokens is too expensive to make it worthwhile.
The consensus is that Claude 3.7 Sonnet remains superior for coding, leading some to call GPT-4.5 “just big” and highlight its lack of new frontier capabilities.

They question if decoupling RoPE is more beneficial for MLA than MHA due to MLA's expansion/contraction properties, particularly how merging weights could streamline the process of small->big and big->small weight matrices into smaller operations.
* They question if decoupling RoPE is more beneficial for MLA than MHA due to MLA's expansion/contraction properties, particularly how merging weights could streamline the process of small->big and big->small weight matrices into smaller operations.
* Efficiency of weight merging in MLA assessed: The user considers whether merging expansion/contraction weights in MLA could transform a small->big and big->small weight matrix into a small->small weight.
The user also suggests that because MHA lacks the same expansion/contraction dynamics, merging weights would offer only marginal efficiency gains compared to MLA.

* GPT-4.5 Performance and Pricing Cause Community Reactions: Early benchmarks of GPT-4.5 show it being outperformed by o1 on several problems, indicating pre-training isn't the optimal place to spend compute in 2025, but one user notes the hallucination metrics are very good. Pricing of GPT-4.5 is expensive at $75.00 per million input tokens and $150/million for output, prompting one user to state this must be the end of scaling.
Another user believes in 1-2 years this will be the default model size.

> GROUP operations AST changes, BEAM search strategies for OptOps, arange GROUP optimization failure, LLVM speed regression

* GROUP AST changes hit performance blocker*: Changes to the AST for *GROUP operations have reached parity with PyTorch when summing (2048,2048) tensors but struggle with (4096,4096) tensors due to the need for multiple successive OptOps.
The author asks whether they should attempt to adjust BEAM search to find these OptOps or modify the lowerer/expander to output something different that will do multiple accumulators.
* The author asks whether they should attempt to adjust BEAM search to find these OptOps or modify the lowerer/expander to output something different that will do multiple accumulators.
* BEAM Search Stalls Out, Frustrates Progress*: The author is facing challenges getting *BEAM search to find the optimal sequence of OptOps needed for efficient summation of larger tensors (4096,4096).
They are considering modifying the lowerer or expander to generate alternative ASTs that could better utilize multiple accumulators and horizontal add swizzles but express uncertainty about guaranteeing performance improvements.

* arange GROUP Optimization, Breaks CI*: The author reports that the arange *GROUP optimization is not being applied, leading to an extra inner loop in arange operations and broken CI.
They rebased onto master and tests are passing, with successful matching of pytorch, asking for any advice there might be on the arange GROUP optimization.
* They rebased onto master and tests are passing, with successful matching of pytorch, asking for any advice there might be on the arange GROUP optimization.
* Speed Test BEAM=2 Times Out****: A member noticed that "Speed Test BEAM=2" is timing out on GitHub Actions.
The author fixed this issue by trimming some of the added OptOps and also reported that adding GROUP and GROUPTOP slowed the BEAM search due to greatly increased number of kernels tried.

* Tests still failing on Pull Request*: A member said that the tests are still failing on the pull request and the code is also a lot slower on *LLVM speed with 0 gain.
The author clarified that they were not asking for a review yet, but wanted to know if the arange tests failing on GROUP OptOps was a known issue.
