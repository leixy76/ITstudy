# AI Twitter Recap
Language Models and Releases

* Google's Gemini models are evolving, with the Gemini 2.0 Flash integrating image input/output capabilities, potentially marking a new paradigm for multimodal language models, as highlighted by @ArtificialAnlys. However, @ArtificialAnlys advises against using Gemini 2.0 Flash for text-to-image tasks and recommends dedicated image generation models like Google’s own Imagen 3. Separately, @_akhaliq notes that Gemini Canvas for coding works with Gemini 2.0 Flash for now.
* Mistral AI released Mistral Small 3.1, adding image input and expanding the context window to 128k tokens, reports @ArtificialAnlys. They also note that it scores an Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index of 35, in line with Mistral 3, GPT-4o mini, and Claude 3.5 Haiku. @ArtificialAnlys notes Mistral's endpoint pricing is $0.1/$0.3 per million input/output tokens. @sophiamyang shared a nice video on MistralAI Small 3.1 from @1littlecoder.
* Allen AI released OLMo-32B, a fully open LLM that beats GPT-4o mini and Qwen 2.5, as highlighted by @mervenoyann. They also note that pre-training was 3x cheaper than Qwen 32B, according to the blog post, and shared models, datasets here.
* @osanseviero introduced ShieldGemma 2, a 4B model for image safety classification, noting it can be used as an input filter for VLMs or for blocking dangerous image generation outputs. @abacaj suggests that ShieldGemma 2 should probably be used over Gemma 3, not just because it's better in some cases but because it's a better license.

Frameworks and Tools

* LangChainAI highlighted several updates, including the launch of Julian by @11x_official, powered by LangGraph, the availability of the book "Learning LangChain" by @nfcampos and @mayowaoshin, the use of LangGraph + AnthropicAI's MCP by @QodoAI for their IDE plug-in, the LangGraph Builder tool, encryption for agent checkpoints in the LangGraph Platform, and an explanation of MCP from scratch. @hwchase17 noted that LangGraph + MCP isn't just buzz words for youtube videos - it's also powering @QodoAI's Gen 1.0 conding assistant, and linked their deep technical dive.
* Jeremy Howard announced fasttransform, a Python library for reversible/extensible data transformations, built on multi-dispatch, in collaboration with @R_Dimm.
* Aidan McLachlan noted this might be like the single highest-leverage open role in the world, referring to a role at @StripeDev. Jeremy Howard showed support of llms.txt standard by thanking StripeDev and other people in the community @StripeDev for supporting it. Karpathy also tagged StripeDev saying simply 👏 @StripeDev.

AI Applications and Use Cases

* Perplexity AI is partnering with Kalshi for March Madness to provide matchup predictions and odds for NCAA basketball, noted by @AravSrinivas. Perplexity AI also launched "Roast My Bracket", where users can upload a screenshot of their bracket and let Perplexity be the judge @perplexity_ai. Aravind also noted that Perplexity can now ingest videos and offer explanations @AravSrinivas.
* @mathemagic1an announced that Codegen is now GA and is built with Claude 3.7 across Slack, Github and Linear. He believes that the long-term agentic capabilities of Claude 3.7 are severely slept on @mathemagic1an because it's capable of doing tasks out of the box that were impossible with massive multi-agent systems even 3 months ago.
* @shaneguML theorizes that the information reversal structure in the English-Japanese translation task is one causality on how Google created Transformer.
* @AravSrinivas announced that Softbank has signed an agreement with Perplexity to be an authorized reseller of Perplexity Enterprise Pro in Japan.
* @jackclarkSF has an exciting job they're hiring for - Policy Demos!, and they've often found the best way to help people understand powerful AI technology is to 'show, not tell', and the best way to do this is to demonstrate the real capabilities of real systems.

Infrastructure, Hardware, and Scaling

* Clement Delangue highlighted a Harvard study on the value of open-source software, noting that $1 invested in open-source generates $2,000 of value and without OSS, companies would need to spend 3.5 times more on software @ClementDelangue.
* @AIDanHendrycks agreed domestic AI chip manufacturing is crucial for competitiveness, and it is discussed in their Superintelligence Strategy, along with deterrence and nonproliferation.
* @jxmnop responded to a tweet by @lauriewired, noting you can always shrink the model to fit your hardware.
* @vllm_project was spotted during Jensen's Keynote @nvidia #GTC.

Concerns and Skepticism

* @ID_AA_Carmack notes that there have been countless efforts to make software development “more visual”, but anything that isn’t a simple collection of human (and LLM!) readable text files continues to step on land mines.
* @nearcyan doesn't buy the whole 'there will be a ton of new jobs' thing for normal people. There will be many new jobs but not for normal people.
* @iScienceLuvr thinks the problem with lots of AI and applied AI research is how near sighted it can be, and most of these papers will be obsolete in like 6 months.

Humor

* @svpino said "Quick reminder: I'm charging $1,000/hour to fix your vibe-coded mess."
* @nearcyan shared that anthropic was down for 6 minutes and so much of their life was in shambles that they thought an internet exchange point blew up or something.

## /r/LocalLlama Recap
Theme 1. Criticism of AI Benchmarks: Goodhart's Law in Action

* After these last 2 weeks of exciting releases, the only thing I know for certain is that benchmarks are largely BS (Score: 671, Comments: 111): The post critiques the reliability of benchmarks for evaluating local LLMs (Large Language Models), suggesting that they can be misleading. It highlights a disparity between those who actively use LLMs in practical applications and those who rely solely on benchmark graphs, implying that the latter may have an overly simplistic view of AI capabilities.
Many commenters agree that benchmarks are being gamed, with models being optimized to excel on them rather than for general use, which echoes Goodhart's Law. This has led to a situation similar to the Volkswagen emissions scandal, where models perform well on tests but not necessarily in real-world applications.
Several users suggest creating personal benchmarks tailored to specific tasks to better evaluate local LLMs. There are concerns about the feasibility of this approach due to the workload involved, and some propose having a wide array of challenging benchmarks to encourage general model improvement.
Discussions highlight that benchmarks often do not reflect real-world tasks, as they focus on easily scored tests rather than complex, practical applications. This discrepancy underscores the need for benchmarks that are more representative of typical tasks and applications.

Someone who asked Claude to rewrite code in the OpenRouter class and said I forgot how to code. If caching is applied automatically, you just have to wait while using the promptWell the way it works in anthropic api is: you just send this payload twice, first time it writes for 1.25x price and then second time it is only 0.1x the price (the part that "hits") but with OR im always paying for the 1.25x Which basically makes the cache even worse I don't know how to use the cache You can ask Toven

> Oracle Feedback, Self-Reflection, Reward Modeling

* Lecture differences revealed: A member pointed out differences between lecture 1 and lecture 2's approaches to LLM training and feedback.
In Lecture 1, oracle feedback is given to the intermediate output for self-correction (see slide 61), whereas in Lecture 2, feedback is integrated in the training loop to improve instruction following and reward modeling capabilities (see slide 52).
* In Lecture 1, oracle feedback is given to the intermediate output for self-correction (see slide 61), whereas in Lecture 2, feedback is integrated in the training loop to improve instruction following and reward modeling capabilities (see slide 52).
* External Oracles Outperform LLM Feedback: The author emphasizes that external oracle feedback far outperforms feedback given by another LLM in Lecture 1.
This is because neither LLM was finetuned to provide good rewards, according to a member.
