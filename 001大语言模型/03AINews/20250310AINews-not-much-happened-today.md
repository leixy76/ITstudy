# AI Reddit Recap
## /r/LocalLlama Recap
Theme 1. Manus Agent: Claude Sonnet Integrated with 29 Tools

* Manus turns out to be just Claude Sonnet + 29 other tools, Reflection 70B vibes ngl (Score: 355, Comments: 112): Manus is revealed to be essentially Claude Sonnet combined with 29 additional tools, drawing comparisons to Reflection 70B. The discussion is fueled by shared links to tweets from Dorialexander and jianxliao, highlighting community reactions and debates around this revelation.
Many users emphasize that Manus is marketed as an agent, not as a new model, and that it's a common misconception to think otherwise. Agents are frameworks that leverage existing LLMs with additional tools, and the term "wrapper" is often misunderstood; it's not derogatory but indicative of adding functionality to base models like Claude.
There are discussions about the open-sourcing of models post-trained for Manus, with skepticism about the uniqueness of Manus given its reliance on existing models like Claude. Some users argue that the true value lies in the agentic architectures and the ability to efficiently utilize multiple tools and models, similar to how the P2LR router model operates.
The hype and marketing strategies in the AI startup space are criticized, with users noting that flashy demos can lead to inflated valuations. The use of invitation codes and the perceived obfuscation of underlying technologies are seen by some as tactics to create artificial exclusivity and mystery around products like Manus.

Theme 2. LLMs not Ready for Large Codebases Yet: Evidence from <70B Evaluations

* <70B models aren't ready to solo codebases yet, but we're gaining momentum and fast (Score: 385, Comments: 47): Models under 70B parameters face challenges in managing large codebases independently, but recent advancements indicate rapid progress in this area. Although specific details or examples are not provided, the sentiment suggests optimism about future capabilities.
Token Usage and Model Limitations: Users discuss the token usage of models like QwQ, noting that even simple tasks can require a large number of tokens, such as 1200 tokens for a basic command. Models struggle with multi-turn tasks, and there's a consensus that current models, including SOTA models, still face significant challenges in handling large-scale codebases effectively.
Advancements in Model Capabilities: There's a recognition of the rapid advancement in model capabilities, with models like Qwen-Coder 32B excelling in iterating on existing codebases. Users note that today's models with fewer parameters can outperform older, larger models, highlighting improvements in finetuning and prompting methodologies.
Practical Limitations and Experimentation: Despite improvements, users express frustration with the inefficiencies and limitations of current models in practical applications. Falconandeagle shares experiences of needing to constantly guide models through tasks, indicating that while models can handle small demos, they struggle with larger, more complex projects. ForsookComparison and others suggest that combining models like QwQ for ideation and Qwen-Coder for iteration might yield better results.

Theme 3. Apple M3 Ultra: Challenges for AI Workloads Compared to Traditional Systems

* Framework and DIGITS suddenly seem underwhelming compared to the 512GB Unified Memory on the new Mac. (Score: 236, Comments: 166): Apple's announcement of the M3 Ultra Mac with 512 GB Unified Memory has shifted expectations, making options like FrameWork and DIGITS with 128 GB seem inadequate. The author expresses concern about potentially being constrained to the Apple ecosystem for the foreseeable future.
Discussions highlight the price disparity between Apple's M3 Ultra Mac ($10k) and alternatives like DIGITS ($3k), with some users noting Apple's offerings are not cost-effective unless price is no concern. Comparisons are made with Framework’s 4x128GB cluster setup, which costs approximately $6.9k but offers significantly lower performance.
Users debate the ecosystem lock-in between Apple and Nvidia, with some expressing hope for future open systems that allow more customization and expansion.

* Model Steerability Shines a Funny Light: The model very often takes your request's pattern and runs with it, regardless of better alternatives because it assumes you know what you want, which can lead to humorous, but potentially inefficient, outcomes.
Adding "Discuss my goal, ideas, and method, what do you think?" before project initiation enables the model to evaluate and optimize the approach.

* 9070 XT Outperforms 7900 XTX, Sometimes: The 9070 XT is generally faster than the 7900 XTX for AI tasks, achieving 44 tok/sec versus 31 tok/sec on a Qwen2.5 coder 14b Q8_0 model using Vulkan, due to the former lacking ROCm support on Windows at the time of discussion.
However, the 7900 XTX has more CU (Compute Units) than the 9070 XT, but the newer architecture gives it an edge.

* Vulkan vs ROCm: A Performance Quagmire: Vulkan performance on AMD is reportedly bugged, running at approximately 1/3 the speed of ROCm, but some users find Vulkan faster than ROCm due to driver issues, this changed around driver version 24.12.1 where it was fixed at the expense of Vulkan performance, but has since been unfixed after 25.1.1

While its bus is weak, it offers faster inference than CPU-only without ROCm jank for around $500, though the inability to split diffusion models is a downside.

* Ring Topology Latency scales linearly with nodes: A member explained that in ring topology, with each processor able to communicate only with its neighbor, the number of communications and operations scales linearly with the number of processors (O(p)) during an AllReduce operation.
This is because it requires p-1 operations/communications to complete the AllReduce.

* Tree Topology Achieves Logarithmic Communication Complexity: The member explained that in tree-based topology, the total number of parallel communications and operations scales logarithmically with the number of tree levels (O(log L)).
Given the assumptions in double binary trees where ranks alternate between nodes and leaves, the complexity can be expressed as O(log p).

* Token Prediction via adding Codebook to Vocab: A member was re-reading the Token Assorted paper and realized that they're probably just adding the codebook to their vocabulary during fine-tuning, which makes the whole thing seem much less interesting.
They feel that you'd probably get better results by just finding the K most common strings or clusters of strings in your reasoning corpus and adding those to your vocab before SFT; selling this as reasoning in latent space is a bit much.
