In a day with monster $250m fundraising and Ilya declaring the end of pretraining, we are glad for Meta to deliver a paper with some technical meat: Byte Latent Transformer: Patches Scale Better Than Tokens.

The abstract is very legible. In contrast to previous byte level work like MambaByte, BLT uses dynamically formed patches that are encoded to latent representations. As the authors say: "Tokenization-based LLMs allocate the same amount of compute to every token. This trades efficiency for performance, since tokens are induced with compression heuristics that are not always correlated with the complexity of predictions. Central to our architecture is the idea that models should dynamically allocate
compute where it is needed. For example, a large transformer is not needed to predict the ending of most
words, since these are comparably easy, low-entropy decisions compared to choosing the first word of a new
sentence. This is reflected in BLT’s architecture (§3) where there are three transformer blocks: two small
byte-level local models and a large global latent transformer."

The authors trained this on ~1T tokens worth of data and compared it with their house model, Llama 3, and it does surprisingly well on standard benchmarks:

but also does much better on tasks that usually trip up tokenizer based models (the CUTE benchmark):

What's next - scale this up? Is this worth throwing everything we know about tokenization out the window? What about Long context/retrieval/IFEval type capabilities?
Possibly byte-level transformers unlock NEW kinds of multimodality, as /r/localllama explains:
> example of such new possibility is "talking to your PDF", when you really do exactly that, without RAG, and chunking by feeding data directly to the model. You can think of all other kinds of crazy use-cases with the model that natively accepts common file types.

Theme 2. Andy Konwinski's $1M Prize for Open-Source AI on SWE-bench

* I’ll give $1M to the first open source AI that gets 90% on contamination-free SWE-bench —xoxo Andy (Score: 449, Comments: 97): Andy Konwinski has announced a $1M prize for the first open-source AI model that scores 90% on a contamination-free SWE-bench. The challenge specifies that both the code and model weights must be open source, and further details can be found on his website.
There is skepticism about the feasibility of achieving 90% on SWE-bench, with Amazon's model only reaching 55%. Concerns are raised about potential gaming of the benchmark due to the lack of required dataset submission, and the challenge of ensuring a truly contamination-free evaluation process.
Andy Konwinski clarifies the competition's integrity by using a new test set of GitHub issues created after submission freeze to ensure contamination-free evaluation. This method, inspired by Kaggle's market prediction competitions, involves a dedicated engineering team to verify the solvability of issues, drawing from the SWE-bench Verified lessons.
The legitimacy of Andy Konwinski and the prize is questioned but later confirmed through his association with Perplexity and Databricks. The initiative is seen as a prototype for future inducement prizes, with plans to potentially continue and expand the competition if significant community engagement is observed.

Theme 4. Meta's Byte Latent Transformer Redefines Tokenization

* Meta's Byte Latent Transformer (BLT) paper looks like the real-deal. Outperforming tokenization models even up to their tested 8B param model size. 2025 may be the year we say goodbye to tokenization. (Score: 90, Comments: 27): Meta's Byte Latent Transformer (BLT) demonstrates significant advancements in language processing, outperforming tokenization models like Llama 3 in various tasks, particularly achieving a 99.9% score in "Spelling" and "Spelling Inverse." The analysis suggests that by 2025, tokenization might become obsolete due to BLT's superior capabilities in language awareness and task performance.
BLT's Key Innovations: The Byte Latent Transformer (BLT) introduces a dynamic patching mechanism that replaces fixed-size tokenization, grouping bytes into variable-length patches based on predicted entropy, enhancing efficiency and robustness. It combines a global transformer with local byte-level transformers, operating directly on bytes, eliminating the need for a pre-defined vocabulary, and improving flexibility and efficiency in handling multilingual data and misspellings.
Potential and Impact: The BLT model's byte-level approach is seen as a breakthrough, opening up new possibilities for applications, such as direct interaction with file types without additional processing steps like RAG. This could simplify multimodal training, allowing the model to process various data types like images, video, and sound as bytes, potentially enabling advanced tasks like byte-editing programs.
Community Resources: The paper and code for BLT are available online, with the paper accessible here and the code on GitHub, providing resources for further exploration and experimentation with the model.

They find gemini-exp-1206 superior to the now-unavailable o1-preview model and consider it sufficient alongside GPT Plus and the Advanced Voice model with Camera.
Gemini-exp-1206 vs. Other Models: Several users argue that gemini-exp-1206 outperforms models like Claude 3.5 and o1 in various coding tasks, with lmsys arena rankings supporting this claim. However, some users note that Gemini is not a direct replacement for o1-Pro, especially for more complex tasks, and others find Gemini inferior in real-world programming applications.
Google's AI Ecosystem Confusion: Users express frustration over the fragmented nature of Google's AI services, citing the confusion caused by multiple platforms like AI Studio, Note LLM, and Gemini. There is a call for a more unified interface to streamline access and usability.
