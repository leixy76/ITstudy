When introducing Operator (our coverage here), sama hinted at more OpenAI Agents soon on the way, but few of us were expecting the next one in 9 days, shipped from Japan on a US Sunday no less:
The blogpost offers more insight into intended usecases, but the bit notable is Deep Research's result on Dan Hendrycks' new HLE benchmark more than doubling the result of o3-mini-high released just on Friday (our coverage here).

They also released a SOTA result on GAIA - which was criticized by coauthors for just releasing public test set results - obviously problematic for an agent that can surf the web, though there is zero reason to question the integrity of this especially when confirmed in footnotes and as samples of the GAIA test traces were published.
OAIDR comes with its own version of the "inference time scaling" chart which is very impressive - not in the scaling of the chart itself, but in the clear rigor demonstrated in the research process that made producing such a chart possible (assuming, of course, that this is research, not marketing, but here the lines are unfortunately blurred to sell a $200/month subscription).

OpenAI staffers confirmed that this is the first time the full o3 has been released in the wild (and gdb says it is "an extremely simple agent"), and the blogpost notes that a "o3-deep-research-mini" version is on the way which will raise rate limits from the 100 queries/month available today.
Reception has been mostly positive, sometimes to the point of hyperventilation. Some folks are making fun of the hyperbole, but on balance we tend to agree with the positive takes of Ethan Mollick and Dan Shipper, though we do experience a lot of failures as well.

Shameless Plug: We will have multiple Deep Research and other agent builders, including the original Gemini Deep Research team, at AI Engineer NYC on Feb 20-22. Last call for applicants!

Theme 4. DeepSeek-R1's Competence in Complex Problem Solving

* DeepSeek-R1 never ever relaxes... (Score: 133, Comments: 30): The DeepSeek-R1 model showcased self-correction abilities by solving a math problem involving palindromic numbers, initially making a mistake but then correcting itself before completing its response. Notably, OpenAI o1 was the only other model to solve the problem, while several other models, including chatgpt-4o-latest-20241120 and claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, failed, raising questions about potential issues with tokenizers, sampling parameters, or the inherent mathematical capabilities of non-thinking LLMs.
Discussions highlight the self-correcting capabilities of LLMs, particularly in zero-shot settings. This ability stems from the model's exposure to training data where errors are corrected, such as on platforms like Stack Overflow, influencing subsequent token predictions to correct mistakes.
DeepSeek-R1 and other models like Mistral Large 2.1 and Gemini Thinking on AI Studio successfully solve the palindromic number problem, while the concept of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models is explored. CoT models are contrasted with non-CoT models, which typically struggle to correct errors mid-response due to different training paradigms.
The conversation delves into the foundational differences in training data across generational models (e.g., gen1, gen1.5, gen2) and the implications of these differences on error correction capabilities. There is a suggestion that presenting model outputs as user inputs for validation might help address these challenges.
