* Some folks had early access
* Has video export
* Lots of misclicks, but does self correct
* Long horizon, remote VMs up to 20 minutes
* Many clones/alternatives from LangChain, smooth operator
* the separate evals notes show how Operator is a SOTA agent, but still not quite at human level. Exhibits a test time scaling curve:
* As Sam says, there are more agents to launch in the coming weeks and months

Theme 3. Tooling for Better Reasoning in AI Models: Enhancements in Open WebUI

* Open WebUI adds reasoning-focused features in two new releases OUT TODAY!!! 0.5.5 adds "Thinking" tag support to streamline reasoning model chats (works with R1) . 0.5.6 brings new "reasoning_effort" parameter to control cognitive effort. (Score: 104, Comments: 18): Open WebUI has released two updates, 0.5.5 and 0.5.6, enhancing reasoning model interactions. Version 0.5.5 introduces a 'think' tag that visually indicates the model's thinking duration, while version 0.5.6 adds a reasoning_effort parameter, allowing users to adjust the cognitive effort exerted by OpenAI models, thus improving customization for complex queries. More details can be found on their GitHub releases page.
The reasoning_effort parameter does not currently impact R1 distilled models, as tested by a user who found no difference in "thinking" time across different settings. The parameter appears to be applicable only to OpenAI reasoning models at this time.
Inference engines need to implement the "reasoning_effort" themselves, as it's not a model parameter. One suggested method is adjusting the sampling scaling coefficient for the "end of thinking" token, which can effectively modify the perceived cognitive effort.
Users are anticipating fixes for rendering artifacts and the addition of MCP support to standardize tool usage, which is expected to enhance the utility of the platform.

* Deepseek R1's Open Source Version Differs from the Official API Version (Score: 80, Comments: 57): Deepseek R1's open-source model shows more censorship on CCP-related issues compared to the official API, contradicting expectations. This discrepancy raises concerns about the accuracy of benchmarks and the potential for biased responses, as the open model may perform worse and spread biased viewpoints, affecting third-party providers and human-ranked leaderboards like LM Arena. Tests reveal the open model interrupts its thinking process on sensitive topics, suggesting the models might not be identical, and researchers should specify which version they use in studies.
There's a clear discrepancy between the open-source model and the official API, with the open model showing more censorship on CCP-related issues. Users, including TempWanderer101 and rnosov, discuss how benchmarks might be inaccurately measuring the open model, and that the models might not be identical, impacting performance and third-party provider quality.
The censorship issue might be related to differences in prompt handling, with rnosov noting that using a tag followed by a newline can bypass censorship in text completion mode. This suggests that the official API might use different templates or hidden prompts, like "approach China-related queries with care," affecting responses.

### GPU MODE ▷ #triton (9 messages🔥):
> Step Execution Order, Data Overwriting Issue, Compiler Behavior, Variable Changes

* Step Execution Order Confusion: A member clarified that step2 must execute before step3 because step3 overwrites the data loaded by step2.

This raised questions about the necessity of ordering when, at first glance, it seemed step2 did not affect step3.
Data Overwriting Issue Raised: It was noted that the discrepancies arise because step3 changes the variable x_c, impacting the outcome of step2 despite x itself remaining untouched.

A member suggested testing changes directly on x instead of x_c to resolve the issue.
Compiler Behavior Under Review: Concerns were shared about the compiler executing step1 and step3 together, leading to potential errors.

One member postulated that this behavior might stem from the fact that x was not being modified.
Attempting Variable Adjustment: A member attempted to adjust the equation to combine x and x_c, but encountered issues when updating it to x=x+x_c0.00001+y0.000001.

An attachment containing the code was shared for further analysis and debugging.
