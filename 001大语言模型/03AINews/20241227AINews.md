As teased over the Christmas break, DeepSeek v3 is here (our previous coverage of DeepSeek v2 here). The benchmarks are as good as you've come to expect from China's frontier open model lab:

(more details on aider and bigcodebench)
But the training details are even better:

* trained on 8-11x less the normal budget of these kinds of models: specifically 2048 H800s (aka "nerfed H100s"), in 2 months. Llama 3 405B was, per their paper, trained on 16k H100s. They estimate this cost $5.5m USD,
* homegrown native FP8 mixed precision training (without having access to Blackwell GPUs - as Shazeer intended?)
* Scaling up Multi-Head Latent Attention from DeepSeek v2
* distilling from R1-generated synthetic reasoning data and using other kinds of reward models
* no need for tensor parallelism - recently named by Ilya as a mistake
* pruning + healing for DeepSeekMoE style MoEs, scaled up to 256 experts (8 active + 1 shared)
* a new "multi token prediction" objective (from Better & Faster Large Language Models via Multi-token Prediction) that allows the model to look ahead and preplan future tokens (in this case just 2 at a time)
