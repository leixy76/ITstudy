[[AINews] Cohere's Command A claims #3 open model spot (after DeepSeek and Gemma) • Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-coheres-command-a-claims-3-open-model-spot/)

We briefly mentioned Cohere's Command A launch last week, but since the announcement was comparatively light on broadly comparable benchmarks (there were some, but the selective, self reported, comparisons to DeepSeek V3 and GPT-4o couldnt really contextualize Command A among either SOTA open source or overall SOTA-for-size), it was hard to tell where it would rank in terms of lasting impact.
With today's LMArena result, that is no longer in question:

As Aidan Gomez points out, Command A actually increases 2 spots in rankings with the Style Control modifier (explored on their LS podcast).
There are many other notable subtle points that make Command A a particularly attractive candidate to include in one's open models arsenal, including the unusually long 256k context window, multilingual capabilities, and focus on optimizing for a 2-H100 serving footprint.

> Self-reflection and self-refinement in LLMs, System prompts and LLM behavior

* Self-Reflection Dichotomy Dilemma Discussed: A member highlighted a contradiction between Lecture 1, stating that self-reflection and self-refinement require external evaluation, and Lecture 2, suggesting LLMs can improve by rewarding their own outputs.
Screenshots from Lecture 1, slide 67 and Lecture 2, slide 51 were attached to illustrate the apparent conflict. See image 1 and image 2.

* System Prompt Reliability Questioned: A member suggested that while system prompts should work, relying on specific behaviors might not be robust, because all these at the end is text input, so the model can process it. You should be able to bypass the framework and service.
They added that the training data looks like <system> You are a helpful assistant </system> <user> Some example user prompt </user> <assistant> Expected LLM output </assistant> and that frameworks may not reliably pass system prompts to all LLMs.
