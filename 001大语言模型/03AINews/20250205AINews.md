In a surprise drop, some researchers released a "little textbook" on how they scale models at GDM:

A commenter confirmed this was GDM internal documentation, with Gemini references redacted.
How To Scale Your Model comes in 12 parts and starts with a nice update of what standard Transformers today look like:

and explains how inference differs from the standard O(N^2) understanding of attention:

but also introduces standard high performance computing concepts like rooflines:

even coming with worked problems for the motivated reader to test their understanding... and comments are being read in realtime.

Theme 4. OpenAI Unveils OpenAI Sans Font

* Refreshed. (Score: 259, Comments: 140): OpenAI has introduced a new font as part of their branding strategy, signaling a refreshed visual identity. The update is part of their ongoing efforts to enhance their brand presence and user engagement.
Many comments draw a comparison between OpenAI's new font and Apple's design ethos, suggesting that OpenAI's design team might include former Apple UX designers. The design change is seen as a strategic move to own a unique font, similar to Apple's creation of the San Francisco font, which reduces long-term licensing costs.
There is skepticism about the need for a new font, with comments suggesting the move is more about branding and justifying investor spending rather than substantial innovation. Some users humorously critique the effort, equating it to spending billions to change a font from Arial to Helvetica.
Several comments highlight the potential disconnect between the design-focused branding strategy and the expectations of a more technically inclined audience. The creation of "OpenAI sans" is seen as a strategic branding move, but its immediate value to non-designers is questioned, with some commenters finding the video presentation excessive and not directly relevant to their interests.
