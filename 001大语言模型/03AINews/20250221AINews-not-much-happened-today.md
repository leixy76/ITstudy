# AI Twitter Recap
Models and Benchmarks, highlighting model releases, performance metrics, and comparisons

* Grok-3, a new family of LLMs from xAI designed for advanced reasoning and problem-solving, using 10x the compute of its predecessor (200,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs), outperforms competitors from Google, Anthropic, and OpenAI on math, science, and coding benchmarks, as reported in The Batch and discussed by @scaling01 who notes that without reasoning models like o3, GPT-5 (what they call GPT-4.5) would have been disappointing.
* DeepSeek-R1 achieves the highest accuracy of 61.82% on SuperGPQA, outperforming o1, o2-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, etc., according to @iScienceLuvr who also notes that SuperGPQA is a more demanding version of GPQA with 26,529 questions across 285 graduate disciplines. @teortaxesTex points out that DeepSeek is from ByteDance Research and they have little reason to overhype it.
* SigLIP 2, a new version of SigLIP from GoogleDeepMind, is released with improved semantic understanding, localization, and dense features, as announced by @_philschmid, @arankomatsuzaki, and @reach_vb. It merges captioning pretraining, self-supervised learning, and online data curation, outperforming its previous version in 10+ tasks, with flexible resolutions, better multilingual capabilities and fairness. It is available in 4 sizes from 86M to 1B parameters on HuggingFace under Apache 2.0. @mervenoyann details the improvements including new masked loss, self-distillation, dense features, and dynamic resolution with Naflex for better OCR, with blog and model links provided by @mervenoyann and @_philschmid. @wightmanr suggests using SigLIP 2 as a go-to ViT encoder.

Theme 2. Langchain's Enduring Complexity and Workflow Challenges

* langchain is still a rabbit hole in 2025 (Score: 187, Comments: 80): The author expresses frustration with Langchain and the Langgraph framework in 2025, citing frequent breaking changes across versions 0.1 to 0.3 that make maintenance challenging. They describe difficulties in using llama.cpp for building custom workflows, mentioning specific issues with the OpenAI-compatible API, buggy Jinja templates, and tool call ID returns, as documented in several GitHub issues (11988, 11847, 11938, 11992).
Many users express frustration with Langchain and Langgraph, describing them as over-engineered with poor documentation and frequent breaking changes. They suggest alternatives like implementing workflows from scratch or using simpler solutions such as Pydantic AI and atomic agents for better control and explainability.
Some users share experiences of moving away from Langchain due to its complexity and reliance on heavy abstractions, which complicates debugging and maintenance. They recommend using native APIs or building custom solutions with basic tools like Python and numpy for more efficient and straightforward development.
There is a general consensus that Langchain is not practical for most projects, with suggestions to explore other frameworks like smolagents and temporal for specific needs. Users emphasize the importance of evaluating the necessity of frameworks and the potential benefits of simpler, more direct approaches to API calls and workflow management.
