Just like Meta's Coconut before it, Huginn's Latent Reasoning Model made a splash today. We agree with Jeremy and Andrej that the best RL will probably not be in English, but we didn't choose this as feature story because presumably DeepSeek already tried that for r1 (our coverage here) and didn't find it worth the tradeoff of not being able to read the thoughts.
