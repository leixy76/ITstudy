With the departure of key researchers, Veo 2 beating Sora Turbo in heads up comparisons, and Noam Shazeer debuting a new Gemini 2.0 Flash Reasoning model, the mood around OpenAI has been tense to say the least.
But patience has been rewarded.
As teased by sama and with clues uncovered by internet sleuths and journalists, the last day of OpenAI's Shipmas brought the biggest announcement: o3 and o3-mini were announced, with breathtaking early benchmark results:

* FrontierMath: the hardest Math benchmark ever (our coverage here) went from 2% -> 25% SOTA
* 
* ARC-AGI: the famously difficult general reasoning benchmark extended in a ~straight line the performance seen by the o1 models, in both o3 low ($20/task) and o3 high ($thousands/task) settings. Greg Kamradt appeared on the announcement to verify this and published a blogpost with their thoughts on the results. As they state, "ARC-AGI-1 took 4 years to go from 0% with GPT-3 in 2020 to 5% in 2024 with GPT-4o". o1 then extended it to 32% in its highest setting, and o3-high pushed to 87.5% (about 11 years worth of progress on the GPT3->4o scaling curve)
* 
* SWEBench-Verified, Codeforces, AIME, GPQA: It's too easy to forget that none of these models existed before September, and o1 was only made available in API this Tuesday:

o1-mini is not to be overlooked, as the distillation team proudly showed off how it has an overwhelmingly superior inference-intelligence curve than o3-full:
as sama says: "on many coding tasks, o3-mini will outperform o1 at a massive cost reduction! i expect this trend to continue, but also that the ability to get marginally more performance for exponentially more money will be really strange."
Eric Wallace also published a post on their o-series deliberative alignment strategy and applications are open for safety researchers to test it out.
Community recap videos, writeups, liveblogs, and architecture speculations are also worth checking out.

* The o3 chart is logarithmic on X axis and linear on Y (Score: 139, Comments: 65): The O3 chart uses a logarithmic X-axis for "Cost Per Task" and a linear Y-axis for "Score," illustrating performance metrics of various models like O1 MIN, O1 PREVIEW, O3 LOW (Tuned), and O3 HIGH (Tuned). Notably, O3 HIGH (Tuned) achieves an 88% score at higher costs, contrasting with O1 LOW's 25% score at a $1 cost, highlighting the trade-off between cost and performance in ARC AGI evaluations.
Several commenters criticize the O3 chart for its misleading representation due to the logarithmic X-axis, with hyperknot highlighting that the chart gives a false impression of linear progress towards AGI. Hyperknot further argues that achieving AGI would require a massive reduction in costs, estimating a need for a 10,000x decrease to make it viable.
Discussions on the cost and practicality of AGI suggest skepticism about its current feasibility, with Uncle___Marty arguing against the trend of increasing model sizes and compute power. Others, like Ansible32, counter that demonstrating functional AGI is valuable, akin to research projects like ITER, although ForsookComparison questions the cost logic, suggesting high expenses might not be justified.
There is debate over the progress in computational hardware, with Chemical_Mode2736 and mrjackspade discussing the potential for cost reductions and exponential improvements in compute power. However, EstarriolOfTheEast points out that recent advancements may not be as significant as they seem due to assumptions like fp8 or fp4 and increased power demands, suggesting a slowdown in exponential improvement.
