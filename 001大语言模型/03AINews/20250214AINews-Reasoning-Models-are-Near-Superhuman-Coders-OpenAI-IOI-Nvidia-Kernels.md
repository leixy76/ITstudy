This has led to concerns about misleading headlines and the potential implications for OpenAI's strategic direction and leadership.

讨论中，大家对于使用的术语也存在一些困惑，有用户指出，所谓 o3 被「取消」的说法并不准确，更准确的说法是它将被整合到 GPT-5 中。这引发了人们对具有误导性的新闻标题的担忧，以及对 OpenAI 的战略方向和领导层可能产生的影响。

Altman said the silent part out loud (Score: 126, Comments: 59): Sam Altman announced that Orion, initially intended to be GPT-5, will instead launch as GPT-4.5, marking it as the final non-CoT model. Reports from Bloomberg, The Information, and The Wall Street Journal indicate that GPT-5 has faced significant challenges, showing less improvement over GPT-4 than its predecessor did. Additionally, the o3 model will not be released separately but will integrate into a unified system named GPT-5, likely due to the high operational costs revealed by the ARC benchmark, which could financially strain OpenAI if widely and frivolously used by users.

Altman 直言不讳（得分：126，评论：59)：Sam Altman 宣布，原计划命名为 GPT-5 的 Orion 将以 GPT-4.5 的名义发布，并将其标记为最终的非 CoT 模型（non-CoT model）。来自 Bloomberg、《The Information》和《华尔街日报》的报告表明，GPT-5 面临着重大挑战，其相对于 GPT-4 的改进幅度不如 GPT-4 相对于其前代模型的改进幅度大。此外，o3 模型不会单独发布，而是会整合到名为 GPT-5 的统一系统中，这很可能是因为 ARC 基准测试显示其运营成本极高，如果用户大量且不加节制地使用，可能会给 OpenAI 带来巨大的财务负担。

Hardware and Costs: The inefficiency of running models on inappropriate hardware, such as Blackwell chips, and the misinterpretation of cost data due to repeated queries, were discussed as factors impacting the launch and operation of GPT-4.5 and GPT-5. Deep Research queries are priced at $0.50 per query, with plans offering 10 for plus members and 2 for free users.

硬件和成本：在不适合的硬件上运行模型，例如 Blackwell 芯片，效率会比较低。此外，由于重复查询造成的成本数据偏差，也被认为是影响 GPT-4.5 和 GPT-5 发布和运营的重要因素。深度研究查询（Deep Research queries）的定价为每次查询 0.50 美元，Plus 会员可以获得 10 次查询机会，免费用户则有 2 次。

Model Evolution and Challenges: There is a consensus that non-CoT models may have reached a scalability limit, prompting a shift towards models with reasoning capabilities. This transition is seen as a necessary evolution, with some suggesting that GPT-5 represents a new direction rather than an iterative improvement over GPT-4.

模型进化与挑战：业界普遍认为，不具备链式推理能力的模型（non-CoT）可能已经达到了扩展瓶颈，因此，发展重点转向了具备推理能力的模型。这种转变被认为是模型发展的必然趋势，甚至有人认为，GPT-5 的出现标志着一个全新的方向，而不仅仅是 GPT-4 的简单升级。

Reasoning and Model Selection: Discussions highlighted the potential advantages of reasoning models, with some users noting that reasoning models like o3 may overthink, while others suggest using a hybrid approach to select the most suitable model for specific tasks. The concept of models with adjustable thinking times being costly was also debated, as well as the potential for OpenAI to implement usage caps to manage expenses.

推理与模型选择：讨论聚焦于推理模型的潜在优势。一些用户指出，像 o3 这样的推理模型可能存在过度推理的问题，而另一些用户则建议采用混合策略，针对特定任务选择最合适的模型。此外，关于具备可调节推理时长的模型成本高昂的问题，也引发了讨论，以及 OpenAI 是否可能通过设置使用上限来控制成本。
