It features all 144 SMs enabled, double the performance in mixed precision training, and possibly the transformer engine from the L40, unlike the 4090. Despite slower memory bandwidth, it offers 48GB memory, 300W TDP, and a GFLOPS/W of 1223.88, making it efficient for setups with multiple cards. More details here.
Memory Bandwidth Concerns: The discussion highlights concerns about the bandwidth drop being "brutal" at less than half, but some users argue that 904GB/s does not feel slow, emphasizing the importance of memory bandwidth relative to memory capacity used per token.
Pricing and Market Appeal: There is skepticism about the card's pricing strategy, with a suggestion that selling at a loss for $500 would be more appealing. However, the digits at 273GB/s are seen as a drawback for potential buyers who prioritize prompt processing.
Prototype and Features: The card is identified as an old prototype, resembling an L40 with ECC disabled and using GDDR6 and PCIe 4.0. It was rumored a year ago alongside the 4090 Ti, and recent GPU-Z screenshots lend some credibility to its existence.
