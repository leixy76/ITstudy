> Pythia Loss Curves, Kaplan-style loss vs compute convex hull plot, FLOPs PPO uses per token

* Pythia's Perilous Plotting Problems: Loss curves for Pythia exist, but WandB metadata was corrupted, making them difficult to interpret.
Additionally, partial training checkpoints aren't accurate proxies for fully trained models due to the impact of the learning rate decay factor, a mistake corrected in the Chinchilla paper.
* Additionally, partial training checkpoints aren't accurate proxies for fully trained models due to the impact of the learning rate decay factor, a mistake corrected in the Chinchilla paper.
* Pondering PPO's Per-Token FLOPs: The FLOPs for generating K tokens and doing a forward pass on K tokens is the same, with an extra forward pass for the reference model, resulting in 3x fwd pass cost for inference, reward, and reference.
With backward passes for the value model and policy, the entire process is estimated to be around 18ND, significantly slower than normal training but each PPO step is probabilistically more valuable.
