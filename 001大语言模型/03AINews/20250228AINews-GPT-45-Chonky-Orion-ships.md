As leaked yesterday and in an early system card, in a (rather underwhelming? but still nice to see) livestream, GPT 4.5 is finally here (as a "research preview" still).
At 15-30x the cost of 4o and much slower, we know its a bigger model, but not much else. Because of the understood benefits of inference-time scaling, the benchmarks will generally underperform the o-series models, but outperform gpt4 and 4o:

Relevant to the other frontier model ship this week, it seems to still underperform Sonnet 3.7 (on which the vibe check jury is still out):

With nothing else interesting in benchmark land, the community is back to exploring "big model smell":

* creative writing samples
* better responses to intent?
* better world knowledge

What's very likely is that GPT-4.5 will serve as the basis for distillation or upscaling to GPT5, which is the confirmed future of OpenAI.

Benchmarks and Evaluations

* GPT-4.5 benchmark performance is under scrutiny, with @jeremyphoward citing data suggesting it is worse and significantly more expensive than DeepSeek v3 on coding tasks like Aider Polyglot. @abacaj also noted that GPT-4.5 is worse than Sonnet 3.5 in initial evaluations. @multimodalart questioned its performance against non-reasoning models like Sonnet 3.7, Deepseek V3, and Grok 3. However, @aidan_mclau cited GPT-4.5's superior accuracy on simpleQA, outperforming Grok-3, GPT-4o, and o3-mini. @scaling01 interpreted OpenAI's system card as indicating pre-training is "dead" and GPT-4.5 is not a frontier model in reasoning.

* DeepSeek-R1 performance was highlighted by @danielhanchen, comparing DualPipe's pipeline parallelism to 1F1B and ZB1P, with links to code and diagrams. @danielhanchen, @danielhanchen. @vllm_project announced FlashMLA in vLLM boosting output throughput for DeepSeek-R1 by 2-16%.

Theme 1. Microsoft Phi-4-multimodal debuts with advanced OCR, audio processing

* Microsoft announces Phi-4-multimodal and Phi-4-mini (Score: 775, Comments: 229): Microsoft has announced the release of Phi-4-multimodal and Phi-4-mini models. Further details about these models were not provided in the post.
The Phi-4-multimodal model, with 5.6B parameters, supports text, image, and speech processing, making it a versatile tool for multimodal tasks. It is noted for its multilingual capabilities, covering languages such as Arabic, Chinese, and English, and has impressive OCR capabilities, as mentioned by MLDataScientist and hainesk. It is not state-of-the-art (SOTA) across all tasks but outperforms individual open-source models in various areas.
The Phi-4-mini model, with 3.8B parameters, reportedly outperforms larger models like gemma2 9b, causing excitement among users like ArcaneThoughts and ForsookComparison. However, there are challenges mentioned by users like danielhanchen regarding conversion issues due to partial_rotary_factor and tokenizer bugs, indicating some technical hurdles in adapting the model for specific uses.
Users express interest in the practical applications of these models, such as speech recognition and image analysis, with questions about their performance compared to existing solutions like Whisper V3. Despite some skepticism about real-world usability due to support and installation issues, as highlighted by ICE0124, the models show promise for local deployment, especially for users without access to high-end GPUs.

Theme 4. LLaDA's Diffusion-based LLM: A Shift in Token Generation

* LLaDA - Large Language Diffusion Model (weights + demo) (Score: 152, Comments: 35): LLaDA introduces a diffusion-based language model with parallelized token generation, allowing for simultaneous prediction of all masked tokens during each reverse process step, reducing the need for high memory bandwidth. The model, available on Hugging Face, promises an alternative architecture that shifts the bottleneck from memory bandwidth to computation, as detailed in its paper.
Discussions highlight LLaDA's departure from traditional left-to-right token generation, exploring its potential for improved reasoning and planning capabilities compared to transformers, which excel at accuracy but struggle with foresight. Users speculate on integrating diffusion techniques like "noise maps" to enhance LLM token prediction, referencing a related paper.
Commenters express curiosity about adapting techniques from image diffusion models to language models, such as text-to-text transformations and inpainting equivalents, considering their potential superiority over current fill-in-middle techniques. They also mention possibilities for more exotic methods like perturbed attention guidance and FreeU.
The model's training with 2.3 trillion tokens and SFT alignment is noted, indicating a robust training process rather than an experimental architecture. Users appreciate the model's concise outputs and suggest that diffusion models may represent a paradigm shift in reasoning models, potentially outperforming current methods.

Theme 1. GPT-4.5's Prohibitive API Pricing and Accessibility Concerns

* GPT-4.5 has an API price of $75/1M input and $150/1M output. ChatGPT Plus users are going to get 5 queries per month with this level of pricing. (Score: 460, Comments: 160): OpenAI's GPT-4.5 API has sparked debate with its pricing of $75 per 1M input tokens and $150 per 1M output tokens, offering ChatGPT Plus users 5 queries per month. The comparison with GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini models highlights their respective pricing and suitability for different tasks, emphasizing user decision-making based on model capabilities and cost.
Many users criticize the high pricing of the GPT-4.5 API, finding it prohibitive for both corporate and personal use. Some express disbelief at the cost, suggesting the model is not worth the price, especially given that it doesn't significantly outperform its predecessors like GPT-4o in reasoning tasks.
There is skepticism about the practical benefits of GPT-4.5, with users noting its performance in subjective areas like writing and EQ rather than in coding or math benchmarks. Discussions highlight the potential diminishing returns of massive pretraining, questioning the model's value over smaller, cheaper alternatives like Claude.
Speculation surrounds the future availability and utility of GPT-4.5, with some users suggesting it might be a public test for a more refined version, such as a potential '4.5o' model. Others mention the possibility of removal from the API, hinting at strategic release decisions by OpenAI amidst resource constraints and competitive pressures.

* Concerns about Internet Speed Affecting Installation: One member expressed frustration about their 40 kb per second internet speed affecting the installation time.
In a light-hearted exchange, another user joked that at that speed it would take approximately two days to complete installation.

* GROUP OptOps matching PyTorch speeds: After rebasing onto master, the PR now successfully matches PyTorch speeds for the summing operation, achieving yellow status on tests.
This progress followed an earlier inquiry about optimizing the arange GROUP tests, which still remains open for discussion.
* This progress followed an earlier inquiry about optimizing the arange GROUP tests, which still remains open for discussion.
* Processing slowdown with BEAM search: The addition of GROUP and GROUPTOP options has potentially slowed down BEAM search due to an increase in the number of kernels to test.
Efforts are underway to identify and remove some OptOp parameters and exclude certain GROUP OptOps preemptively to improve search speed.
* Efforts are underway to identify and remove some OptOp parameters and exclude certain GROUP OptOps preemptively to improve search speed.
* Feedback and review process outlined: George Hotz mentioned that reviews would not be conducted until tests are passing and emphasized the importance of fixing failing tests.
He noted that performance on LLVM had decreased with no observable gain, reinforcing the need for effective solutions.

* Seeking context on arange tests: Vitalsoftware asked for any known issues regarding failures in arange tests related to GROUP OptOps, seeking context before diving in.
There was some uncertainty about whether this issue fell within the scope of the current work, but Vitalsoftware expressed willingness to address it regardless.

* Local repro of timing issues: Vitalsoftware is currently reproducing locally to compare the branch against master, attempting to identify any performance hindrances.
He is keeping an eye on potential inefficiencies from the newly added GROUP OptOps and considering solutions to mitigate test timeouts.
