Meta starts the week strong with an open model (1B, 3B, 7B) and paper release that you can use immediately: Apollo: An Exploration of Video Understanding in Large Multimodal Models.
While the paper is very tentatively titled, the Huggingface demo shows off how it works in practice, consuming a 24min sample video easily:

the authors credit their development of "Scaling Consistency" to their efficient scaling up of experiments.

They also introduce ApolloBench, a subset of existing benchmarks (e.g. Video-MME, MLVU, LongVideoBench) that cuts evaluation time by 41× (with high correlation) while offering detailed insights in five broad temporal perception categories: Temporal OCR, Egocentric, Spatial,
Perception, and Reasoning.
Perhaps the most entertaining part of the paper was the passive aggressive abstract: "Despite the rapid integration of video perception capabilities into Large Multimodal Models (LMMs),
the underlying mechanisms driving their video understanding remain poorly understood. Consequently,
many design decisions in this domain are made without proper justification or analysis."
Well okay Meta, shots fired.

Theme 1. Meta's Apollo Multimodal Models: Local Execution and VRAM Efficiency

* Meta releases the Apollo family of Large Multimodal Models. The 7B is SOTA and can comprehend a 1 hour long video. You can run this locally. (Score: 686, Comments: 108): Meta has released the Apollo family of Large Multimodal Models, with the 7B model being state-of-the-art (SOTA) and capable of comprehending a 1-hour long video. These models can be executed locally, offering significant advancements in multimodal AI capabilities.
Discussions highlight the Apollo model's impressive video comprehension capabilities, with the ability to understand up to an hour of video. Users are intrigued by its temporal reasoning and complex video question-answering abilities, with benchmarks showing Apollo-7B surpassing models with over 30B parameters.
There is debate over the authorship and affiliation of the Apollo project, with some confusion about whether it is a Meta release. It turns out to be a collaboration between Meta and Stanford, with the Qwen model being noted as the base, raising questions about its suitability for video processing.
VRAM requirements for the models are discussed, with the 7B model requiring just under 15GB of VRAM. Users also discuss quantization effects on VRAM usage and performance, noting that FP16 is typically used, but further quantization to FP8 or FP4 can reduce memory usage at the cost of performance.

* Answering my own question, I got Apollo working locally with a 3090 (Score: 84, Comments: 12): The author successfully ran Meta's Apollo locally using a 3090 GPU and shared a GitHub repository with necessary fixes for the local environment. The setup was tested on Python 3.11 on Linux, with a video size of approximately 190Mb and a processing time of around 40 seconds to generate the first token.
Challenges with Meta's Apollo included hardcoded elements, undocumented environments, and the lack of example files, which made the setup not initially plug-and-play. No_Pilot_1974 addressed these issues by adding necessary fixes and making it venv-ready.
There is a sentiment that some open-source projects lack documentation and use hardcoded values, making them difficult to reproduce. This issue is seen often in preference optimization papers.
ForsookComparison praised the original poster's perseverance in resolving issues independently and sharing solutions, highlighting the proactive approach of fixing and documenting the setup for others.

Theme 2. Criticism and Examination of Chain Of Thought Prompts

* Everyone share their favorite chain of thought prompts! (Score: 243, Comments: 56): The post shares a Chain of Thought (COT) prompt designed for logic and creativity, emphasizing structured problem-solving using tags like , , , and . It suggests a 20-step budget, with quality scores guiding strategy adjustments, and encourages using LaTeX for mathematical notation and multiple solution exploration, culminating in a final answer and reflection.
Model Compatibility and Limitations: Discussions highlight that many AI systems, including ChatGPT, do not support explicit Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts due to guidelines against revealing intermediate reasoning. Users noted that models like o1 might flag CoT prompts as content violations, and ClosedAI advises against using CoT prompts on certain models like o1.
Workflow Applications vs. Single Prompts: Some users advocate for using workflow applications like N8N, Omnichain, and Wilmer to manage complex multi-step reasoning processes more effectively than single prompts. These tools allow users to break down tasks into multiple steps, offering greater flexibility and control over AI outputs, as detailed in examples of coding and factual workflows.
Fine-Tuning and Prompt Optimization: Users discuss fine-tuning models with CoT prompts to enhance performance, with one user sharing a 3B model on Hugging Face. The conversation also touches on prompt optimization frameworks like TextGrad and DSPy to improve results, suggesting their potential to expedite achieving desired outcomes.

* Someone posted some numbers for LLM on the Intel B580. It's fast. (Score: 94, Comments: 56): Intel B580 shows slightly better performance than the A770 on Windows, with the B580 achieving around 35.89 to 35.45 in Vulkan, RPC benchmarks, while the updated A770 driver improves its performance significantly to 30.52 to 30.06. The older Linux driver on the A770 yielded much slower results, ranging from 11.10 to 10.98, indicating that driver updates can substantially impact performance.
Intel's B580 Performance: There's a discussion about the unexpected performance of the B580 surpassing the A770 despite the latter's theoretically superior specs, with the A770 expected to be 22% faster due to higher memory bandwidth. Some users suggest that Intel's second-generation cards show improvement over AMD, while others note that the A770 hasn't met its potential, possibly due to inefficiencies in memory usage or compute limitations.
Driver and Software Impact: The comments highlight the significant role of software and driver updates on performance, particularly on different operating systems and configurations. The A770 under Linux with tools like SYCL and IPEX-LLM showed varied results, and the challenges of using Intel's software stack, such as oneAPI on Fedora, were noted.
Market and Scalping Concerns: Users express frustration over scalpers marking up the price of the B580 by $150, indicating high demand and potential supply issues. There's a sentiment that Intel could capitalize on these cards' popularity if they managed production and distribution more effectively.
